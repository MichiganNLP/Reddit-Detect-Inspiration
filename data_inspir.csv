18ypya,"So I'm late to the party, but this was actually very uplifting. I broke up with my boyfriend of three years recently and smoking has helped, but the perspective you have on it is much better than mine. I was smoking to get rid of/forget the pain, but I'll keep what you said in mind before I toke now. c:"
8u3p2f,"Nobody talks about how hard it is after college. Do you have any hobbies you like? I know a friend who made a group via a pottery studio she joined and participated in. Also, exercise is a big one and you can handle two birds with one stone. If you're capable, joining something like a running club or a rowing club is an amazing was to make friends. You have a common bond, you work together to uplift each other, and there are always parties etc. You don't even need to be super in shape to sign up."
194wmf,"&gt;I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me.Jeremiah 32:40"
1h8ctp,"But how else can we trivialize someone else's opinion because it doesn't match up with our own perceptions?? Some of the people here are sensitive, and need some mechanism by which they can feel self-righteous about their beliefs and uplift their fragile egos.^(Edit: See? Sensitive super special snowflakes become contrary, combative or aggressive when their fragile egos are challenged.)"
17pkxd,"A lot of jobs in the tech industry have a similar mentality. The idea is that if your employees are inspired and motivated enough (which they would be at a company like Google, Netflix), they'll come in anyway and probably end up working more than any 9-5 required hours."
16duj6,"Coming from an insanely small high school choir program, I didn't have a chance to hear or perform any of your works until college, and it blew my mind. We performed Water Night my freshman year and I almost cried during the performance because I was so blown away by the beauty of your piece. I also had the privilege of performing Leonardo Dreams and i thank you god and every time I thought I couldn't love your music more, I was wrong. Thank you so much for your inspiring and beautiful music."
15z0ot,"I think its okay to post things like that on Facebook, it can inspire alot of people"
6n55m6,"Thank you for your honorable service. Trans people in the military are, in my mind, our greatest heroes. Thank you for the courage to stand up for yourself, for the immense depth of character it takes just to be your authentic self in the face of such vile hatred as that spread by the likes of that wretched little homunculus. You inspire me. You uplift me and give me strength. I love you, and today, you are my hero."
16c0zm,"Inspiring! That's what yoga is about! Your body, your progress."
1828h3,"It is a show that created quite an amazing fandom within a short time.I have seen the show inspire many people; the show and its fans helped support many folks.In a nutshell, I was a 30 year old depressed army vet going no where. Interacting with folks in the fandom brought out my creative side, I never wrote anything just for fun since high school. The community helped encourage me. Got my life better on track, and heck I even went back to school (again). I'm even taking some English courses to help improve my grammar."
16wkh9,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ""Once More with Feeling"", the scene when the Scoobies are singing ""Walk Through the Fire"". The group is splintered and everyone is feeling dispirited. Each character gets a solo in which s/he wrestles with guilt or worry, then overcomes it. Seeing them all independently decide to fight on, even when they're all feeling terrible, is so uplifting.The gradual blending of the individual voices into a chorus is a total goosebumps moment. I think the fact that they didn't use voice doubles makes it all the more poignant."
18pjhq,will these help?Basic and clothed versions:As for weapons look at the videos for a sense of perspective.Edit: Official ones from Artizens here.Maybe something will inspire you to draw!PS Edit: female.
16a3y8,"All those things, emotions, memories etc cease to exist when your brain dies. There is no afterlife. This my seem like a confronting concept for you, but its actually very inspiring. Every breath you take is all the sweeter when you know that this is my only chance to exist as I am, and like foot prints in the sand I to will one day disappear forever."
18osg5,The sandwich artist who made this was inspired by Jackson Pollack.
16vjbn,"Okay so I'm one of those easily inspired people so this will be hard but I'd like to share with you something that [gives me courage]( Haha, no that was just me being childish.I don't know if this has been entered but [this is one]( that people love to watch, it's a guy called Nick Vujicic and what he says is very poignant is entirely true. I always love how much he inspires other people, it's awesome that he changes peoples lives for the better just with words."
16bqfa,"Very, very inspiring, you did what most would deem impossible, you set your mind on something and you stuck it through and made a success of it! Thank you, I truly am inspired by what you have achieved!"
177fzp,"Hello! I currently hold 2 tickets to see you guys in Austin, TX in April. I'm beyond excited and I find your music absolutely inspirational and uplifting. I just have a simple quick question!What are some of your influences and inspirations when you write your songs?Have a wonderful and fun day!"
16bwx9,"Miracle of Sound is a musician who composes and performs fantastic original music inspired by particular games. I've always found his work irresistible, especially if you've played the game that inspired a particular song. Some of his best work, in my opinion:*[Sovngarde Song](*[Distant Honor](*[Calamity](Unfortunately, he's recently developed tinnitus and is not currently producing music, but his work so far is pretty amazing."
18tjjv,I've played Call of Cthulhu RPG and this game is definitely inspired by it. Call of Cthulhu is a roleplaying game(like dungeons and dragons but set in the HP Lovecraft universe. It's fun as hell and I prefer this over mansion of madness any day. The book is 20 buck at Walmart.com check it out
16z0sl,"Damn. Listening to it right now, and I'm simply amazed. Foals always inspired me a lot with their music, gradually becoming more emotional throughout the albums. (Antidotes was not my favorite in that regard) Holy Fire is a harmonious combination of energy, emotion, freshness, calm, melancholy and joy. It's a very profound sounding music that they make. I'm baffled, and also kind of angry with myself since I couldn't resist listening to the leaked, 128k version. I know I will enjoy this record a thousand times more on CD and recommend anyone buying this brilliant piece of art !"
15s03o,"unconventional choice, i suppose.. but Han Christain Anderson's The little Mermaid. The total sacrificial and benevolent nature of the little mermaid inspired my character to this day, albeit.. however healthy/unhealthy in may be. Also, Sara Crewe from Frances Hogdson Burnett's The Little Princesss children's book. Again, the sacrificial and benevolent nature even as she was reduced to abject poverty."
37lb37,"Prominence is about identifying the highest point of an uplift. In the case of Bowlen and Little, Little has that privilege, so you just measure Bowmen from the col.It's more about mountain building processes than about shape of the peak."
2vg0be,"Fostering new societies, sorta stealing from scifi author David Brin, but if we could uplift other species to human level sentience or higher, bringing in those other perspectives would lead to so many philosophical ideas, and perhaps even technological ideas. Maybe we won't be the ones to explore or survive space, maybe we're here to boost other species into space. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that, but maybe we're the giants."
165p4f,You look absolutely incredible. What a transformation! You inspire me :)
50cy4q,"I can't call it a race, because it is made up of many races. But if you get selected to become a Celestial then I guess you are pretty chosen. Celestials come and uplift species. They select a relatively small number of members of said species and uplift them further, celestializing them, making them essentially immortal and then they go about uplifting other species."
184yf5,"Seriously, the quality of /r/IamA is up to how you guys, the community, vote.If you want this subreddit to continue to have good quality AMAs from interesting people from various walks of life, you will need to continue to provide plenty of thought-provoking, discussion-inspiring questions and remove the inane rubbish that seems to get upvoted to the top of most popular AMAs.If all that gets posted is memes, joke questions, etc, this place will be known as ""that goofy place to promote your stuff"" and the people that want to hold good AMAs will go elsewhere.The choice is yours."
6mmhoe,You might be able to uplift some species and set them as spiritualist via events then use that species liberally to colonize other planets and grow their pops. Or maybe you can enlighten some pre-ftl civ with Spiritual ethos. Also note what attracts pops to the spiritualist ethos
16poae,"Hello WarwickJust wanted to say I loved watching you in ""Willow""- it was my favourite childhood movie and inspired me to be myself. I know it sounds cheesey but that movie always reminds me of my childhood and the music when you were sledding on the shield always makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. All the best!"
922eg4,I would definitely recommend UpLift Desk. Custom automatic height-adjustable desk at a very reasonable price. Very minimalist too.
16f26i,Volunteer: you'll probably see a few things that inspire you! :)
15ri3o,This piece inspired me to pick up the cello two years ago. It holds a place in my heart.
18sqte,"Oh yeah, anything by Ghibli you can expect to be really good with a nice message behind it. Another one of their films, Howl's Moving Castle has a very strong anti-war message.Edit: Just read the wiki page on it, apparently Miyazaki is a pacifist and this movie was directly inspired by the Iraq war."
18htqp,"Don't worry about a goal of a word count, worry about getting the story out of your head and into printed form. Let the momentum from today's progress inspire you to keep going tomorrow and the next day, your word count on Feb 28th doesn't mean anything compared to the goal of finishing your story, whatever the length of it may be."
16iect,There are some absolutely amazing guitarists out there but no one has inspired me like John Frusciante has
2golaf,"Workout or watch motivational videos by Eric Thomas, both always uplift my mood :)"
57q3fu,"I'm conflicted. Part of me wants to buy a piece of property, off the grid, and live the rest of my days in peace and quiet. The other part feels compelled to use my disposable income to help others. Things like uplift poverty stricken communities, raise education standards across the globe and protect endangered habitats and species."

16pg8n,Good luck!This is my journey: Hopefully it can inspire you and if you have any questions you're more than welcome to ask!
70e4f8,"Agree, use the flowchart. That said, If you retirement savings are all sorted, then I'd stick it all in an ISA in a FTSE100 tracker and just leave it. If you don't have retirement all sorted: do the same with a SIPP but bleed the money in to take advantage of the tax uplift. Also has the advantage, that one, of allowing flexibility over the bleed in period while your new career strategy materializes."
16ty9c,Cool. Hope to be inspired by more interesting posts soon.
160kvr,For me the best ever transformation is when Goku turns super saiyan at the martial arts tournament after being challenged by Vegeta.For me obviously the whole scene is one of the best ((if not 'the' best moments in DBZ)) but also It my favorite animation of a SSJ transformation as well.Its the slow uplift of the hair before it stands on end that I love instead of the sudden flash.skip to 1:57
8za6t4,Generally speaking this is called uplift when it happens to animals
17sb45,"When I admitted I needed help with depression, that it was bigger than me, the realization that this is something I was gonna be dealing with my whole life, and my decision to seek counseling was like a huge weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. I had been fighting depression for years and the admission to myself that i needed help, and I was going to get it was such an uplifting moment."

7s06pr,"Can't you already ""create the perfect species""? Organic ascension +uplift gives you alot of freedom"
18zkmq,A) Good for you for trying to make a few kids' lives better by teaching them music. I find that inspiring.B) Check with some local schools for instruments that they no longer use. Also check with music stores that have rentals that they'd like to donate. Remind them that it's tax deductible if they want to get rid of a few older rentals.
16vssn,Jimmy Carter continues to impress and inspire me. He is an American treasure.
18nk5k,"""Inspired by God"" takes on a whole new meaning then."
17ok8r,[*The Commitments*]( is the finest film ever made forever and ever amen. And the trailer actually manages to give a decent impression of this out-of-nowhere kitchen-sink depressive uplifting musical drama. Which is a feat in itself.
187e8r,you inspired me for the day :) you look so good!
169174,"More people need to be familiar with the multiplier effect from economics. Don't mix up NASA's individual balance sheet with the return it gives to the national economy.

5960mn,"In my experience, I vape very small amounts at 330f for reduced anxiety and improved focus. Good mood uplift and happiness, but mainly motivation and focus. No cognitive impairment. At this level energy is improved.I vape at 420f for recreational purposes, aka to get stoned. Sedated, relaxed and euphoric.There is a huge difference between being high and being stoned. I highly, highly recommend using just a tiny pinch during your sessions for the best effects (and to save money.)"

16mqki,That's so good! This makes me want to try to make my own. Very inspiring.
174lt5,"I read The Alchemist at a time when I was feeling a bit low, it's not hard to read by any stretch, very straightforward in the delivery of its overall message, but a nice quick read.In a similar vein, going more on your books about happiness stipulation than being purely fictional (although I'm sure most of it is), the supposedly autobiographical Way of the Peaceful Warrior was something that really inspired me at a low point years earlier."

18jmll,"thank you, very inspiring. I like your points about imperfections, I've been noticing that too..all the best"
18owb7,"That's basically how I am treating this. I was a potsmoker and now I'm not. I hung something up by my mirror so I can remind myself everyday. Reading how other people quit other drug/alcohol addictions is inspiring. If you are posting here, chances are you had or have a problem with something and it's a good idea to be black and white about it. Good luck."
4h8g5j,"I've went for runs and/or exercised six out of seven days in the past week if not more. Though I've been running more with the warming weather, it's still fairly dismal here in the Midwest. Running with a couple friends has helped me connect the dots between my solitary sojourns. I'm starting to see a slight mood uplift with slightly better focus, so I'm hoping to get some important work done tomorrow along with another good workout.Best wishes to all!"

18ssv9,"Start composing and keep it simple. Eventually you'll start thinking of lines to play but your hands won't actually be able to play them. Practice until you can. Is it speed keeping you? Bust out the metronome everyday for 20 minutes and do different timing exercises. If it's technique, again just practice in different applications. If the drive isn't there, it isn't there. Simply put, what you're missing is inspiration. Try to get inspired to write a song, for any reason."
191ylv,"I came to see you talk at TedxRedmond, it was really awesome and inspiring! :DSo, questions: How were you able to carry out the experiment?

16lh31,"Similar story here. I started skiing again, mostly for better backcountry access. It is pretty fun to rediscover. Despite years of boarding I find I'm more comfortable catching large air on skis, possibly because I learned skiing as a young daredevil, or because the release bindings inspire courage. Other than that you aren't missing much. On hard old snow I like skis better but on the powder days on the resort I usually choose my board."
1620zq,"You do know, it's in your last sentence. Just don't feel bad about where you are now because feeling bad won't improve anything. When the inspiration comes, it will come and you'll be inspired to act on it. Make sure you do. Until then, enjoy your life now."
16u34x,"Reading the comments and responses made me extremely sad and also grateful that I have never been in this mindset. For all those people that helped someone else avoid death, you're awesome.

7v97bg,"Sometimes being nice to someone isn't always the best thing for them. It's better to be honest IMO. Why should I treat someone who wishes me harm in this manner? Its great to uplift people but sometimes people can be blind to their own shortcomings unless they are pointed out. You can't become better if you don't acknowledge where you are right now. Love has many forms and is not always lovey-dovey, but it is never cruel just for the sake of being cruel."
6u4btq,"Neoliberalism is most appealing to me because it aims to help uplift the global and local poor through evidence-based policy. There is no promise of a utopia or ethno-nationalist state. There is no supplicating to a divine power or overlord (aside from mr bernke, who counts as both). The only requirement is that you go where the evidence goes. The only real requirements I see are: doing the most help with the least amount of friction and pain, relying on evidence to base your policy positions (reals vs feels), and thanking mr bernke."

1669tj,"While I tend to shy away from investing too much in the Medieval Fantasy trope, my current project leans in that direction. The twist is that it's not European, but a [Fantasy Counterpart Culture]( to the [Mississippians]( and neighboring nations, with some anachronisms thrown in, such as adding iron to the list of metals they work, more domesticated native animals, and incorporating some writing systems inspired by real-life ones that were post-Columbian inventions."

15rbvx,I have been lucky to meet [Libor Šmoldas]( you guys probably are not familiar with him but he is a famous jazz guitar player in the Czech Republic. I have attended a summer workshop with him twice and he is a great dude and he has inspired me to become a guitar teacher. I just love his philosophy when it comes to playing and teaching. He is really having a good time every time he plays. Playing with him has immensly opened my ears and thanks to his influence I almost completely got rid of stage-fright.

However, the Djeedi are far from united and dissenters soon infiltrated the city. What was meant to uplift ~~and control~~ a previously unimportant country instead became a stockpile of resources to be scavenged by warring tribes."

174cxr,"The glacial buzzsaw theory sets a limit on how tall mountains can get. The idea is that if a mountain is tall enough it will have glaciers on it. Glaciers are very erosive, much more than rainfall. Also the thicker a glacier is, the more erosive they become. So if a mountain continues to grow it's glaciers will also grow. The problem of how tall a mountain can get is essentially a balancing problem between the rate of uplift and the rate of erosion. [Video explanation]("

4gatz4,"People dont think just offensive players can make plays, change games, make big plays. People think QBs change games and uplift franchises. You can try building Denvers defense by getting 3 good corners, 2 good LBs, 3 good DL and one great one.or you pray you get a franchise QB who can keep you competing through the length of their career. One or two years dont change the importance of the QB position."

Smiles are addicting, theyre just like chocolate treats- fun to see, share and give, and makes you feel so sweet? I hope that helps."
1rwda9,"Unfortunately it sounds like you'd be better off walking away from that situation. Your partner is supposed to uplift you, not bring you down. Youre obviously not happy. Don't stay because of convenience or because of the time already invested. If you want it to work you have to talk to her. Its up to her to make a change to keep you together. If its important enough to her, she will make changes. If not, that's your answer."
179zgk,"1. The various books of Kallistos (Timothy) Ware are probably the best place for a Westerner to start (I say this as an Anglican and a Westerner).2. For a stunning look at Eastern soteriology, read Alexander Schmemann's *For the Life of the World*. It's deep and meaty, but understandable, awe inspiring, and life changing."
17z3mh,"Medieval Gregorian &amp; Byzantine chants. The music of the Central European Orthodox church. The glorious, meditative music of many religions. It seems that the spiritually inspired make good tunes. Like the music, still don't believe."
18nqzv,"Wow, this deserves more credit! Nice job, you've inspired me to draw more Pokemon now. I'm sure this took a long time. Drawing Pokemon this accurate can be very meticulous."
17ypny,Share your progress. He will be inspired to share his.
17jpl5,"Amazing. And haunting and sad. And yet beautiful and inspiring. All together. Think of the years of hunger and misery, and the struggle for mastery and survival, and the clinging to faith and to family that kept them through all this time."
96w3zi,"When I have energy, I support and uplift and celebrate others. I surround myself with people who do the same, and when I don't have energy they step up for me. On bad days I also consume lots of art and read subreddits like /r/upliftingnews or /r/wholesomememes."
16v0xd,"A website that contains a series of articles of all categories that can be used as an entertaining, inspiring, or an informational cure for boredom."
16ox3s,"And they say weed makes you un-motivated. I think being completely comfortable with your life is a bad thing - there is always more to see, to do, to experience. You can always grow, learn, and improve yourself. But I'm in no position to judge you, that is not my place. I would hope, though, that I could inspire you to strive for more."
17b2v5,Nothing more inspiring than the thought of the government and corporations who fund it squirming like the vermin they are. Thank you Anonymous! /salute
161z7g,"That's awesome that the show got you into art. For a relatively short time, you've made strong strides in development. Mlp did the same for me. Before, I felt like I had no purpose with art or ability to draw but my love for the show and it's style overwritten the feeling I had with something more honest and pure - a joy for drawing. I forgot about trying to be a good artist and just drew what I liked or what inspired me and I feel strongly better about my art now."
18bhme,"Mr. Gates, I just want to say that you're an inspiration to many people. You worked with my father in the early microsoft years and he still talks about how kind, funny, and interesting you were as a person. He also has great stories about the parties you used to hold when the company was smaller. I have great memories of trick-or-treating at your office. I met you during a company picnic once. So much respect for all the good you do in the world. Your philanthropy and dedication are so inspiring."
18bhme,You are a very generous and humble person! Who or what inspired you to dedicate time to philanthropic endeavors? Thank you and your wife for using your great wealth and power to save others. You're an inspiration!
4dc94s,"Cannock Chase isn't too far away and apparently has some pretty good riding. If you're prepared to travel a bit, Bike Park Wales offers rental and an uplift service, as well as proper downhill trails. If you want to do some trail riding, Afan might be a good shout. You can rent bikes there too, but you have to pedal to get to the top. Fantastic riding though."
16ibjx,"don't get inspired just for the sake of it, stick to it and keep on it, for 2 years I started on and off and I lost the most amount of weight these past two months and I didn't get inspired just one morning woke up and went at it and I never stoped....or never will!"
18bc31,"Motivation is key.Some mornings I look out, it's cold raining wet and miserable, I just pop in my headphones and play some uplifting music, stuff to get you pumped up.Failing that, run with others. That way you have the motivation of not letting others down. Join a crew so if you cancel it's not yourself you're letting down, but the crew."
1837oa,It's uplifting to hear your progress and your self control! Keep it up!
161buk,The rest of Reddit must see this. That man taught you a very valuable lesson about life and it is truly inspiring.

18c1an,"Just get up and move... think of it as doing them a favour and you'll get over it.Think of it the other way round, would you want to sit next to a stranger who becomes so attached to the stranger who just sat next to them that they get personally offended when you move away?Only people with personality disorders are like that. Normal people are just thinking the same thing but are too afraid to take the initiative.Be the one who takes the initiative, inspire others."

504yjm,"Such a solid groove - I love Alex's arpeggiated line during the chorus (similar to what I was enjoying in Vapor Trail).The chords of the verse have a sad slow descent that lands with a slight uplift, echoing the theme of the lyrics (drowning in loss and grief, but there's a lifeline to be found).Deceptively simple song. Maybe the lyrics are a bit too on the nose, but they're also pretty raw and honest. A hidden gem."
16unxj,"I can speak from my experience. If I take a furlough from the gym. After about two weeks i'm really irritable. I get extra tired and it gets hard to get back to the gym, because why waste all that time. After one day back at the gym I feel uplifted. And after going for two weeks I feel balanced. It's not like i'm super happy after I workout. After two weeks I feel like i'm tougher to the little things that use to send me over the edge in anger or get me depressed."

I am eating fish and fruit mostly and my calorie limit is 1550 (I'm going to change it to the same as yours right now in luck and honor)So any other tips?"
164aa6,"What I like about this image: when I look at this image, I don't see Storm (even though I think it's suppose to be). I see a different young girl from a rough background who has found strength in the Xman, queen, goddess, Storm. I like that idea a lot. I think a mutant revolutionary who obtains royalty would be very inspiring to young people struggling with adversity. That is what makes this fresh to me."
175tp8,"This movie has really changed my view on the world. I mean, i'm sure we﻿ all knew this stuff, but the amazing high definition angles and inspiring words really help shake things up in my mind. This is one of those movies where you wake up the next morning and see everything in a completely different way. I am no longer a working gear in a consumerist machine, I am an awareness in a sea of human beings. With an equal love for life, and an equal goal of the survival of the species."
18ngcg,"I had completely forgotten about that game! My friends and I were inspired to build our own trebuchet for a science experiment in high school because of that game. We used a water barrel as the counter weight and flung a dummy about two feet in the air.Good times.Anyway, thank you for showing me something else to do at work besides redditting."
5zbek1,"From my personal experience cannabis does improve and uplift the Asana portion of the practice. Possibly provide very profound insights or visions. BUT, if you want to transcend into a deep Savasana, Cannabis will inhibit your ability to do so. I recently quit smoking due to my Pranayama practice not being as fulfilling, consider edibles if you want to minimize the smoke in your lungs. I personally quit all together but respect folks who enjoy the herb."
17m7lu,Bravo! You are heroic and wonderful. I've sent the link to my college daughter to inspire her.
18g2ua,"Love, love, LOVE Dolly. I heard her on NPR recently because she had just written a book about following your dreams. I couldn't believe how many people were calling in telling her how much she had inspired them. I really had no idea prior to hearing this interview just how awesome she is. She didn't even mention this mail order book thing til a caller mentioned it."
15x9qc,"One is Waking Dreams. The first time I heard it my mom called to tell me she had gotten stuck at work and then was in traffic. The traffic was due to someone shooting people in cars on the highway, had she not gotten delayed she might have been one of them.My other is Overcome, it has such inspiring lyrics and helped me turn my life around."
16pfgn,"I've seen lots of people ask for alternatives to PF Tek and normally people say just go with it, or you risk contamination etc etc. I've seen lots of people say you won't have success with just soil/compost/etc, so this is pretty inspiring."

17e2tk,Yes. Playing with friends makes it that much better too. While it's not the longest game in the world I've played through it several times with different creatures and such. That's solo too. I've never regretted buying it. In fact typing this has inspired me to play it now.

18jjba,Getting gifts from students is so uplifting because (from experience) they won't bring you a gift if they hate you.
65mqqa,"It really depends on how that money is used. If that thousand people go out and buy some luxury good or the like, that wealth gets diffused and little changes.That one person could likely use that million (or a million in general) to invest in a company that eventually grows to hire more individuals and generally uplift the economy.If you've ever seen Shark Tank, that's the idea."

178p36,"They failed to conduct regular acts of inspiring civil disobedience. The ""occupy the ports"" activism was by far the most substantial, imo.It substantially frightened the establishment while at the same time helping disenfranchised port employees. Marching in square circles around NYC chanting ""who's streets, our streets"" just got old after a while. That said, I hope they return in the summer and evolve into a more formidable activist outfit."
18zbis,"Check out Takashi Terauchi. Specifically an album from the 60s called ""This is Terauchi Bushi"" that found a new western audience thanks to WFMU.

17728x,"Although it appears that you've received at least one downvote, I think this subreddit could really flourish with this kind of content. Maybe it could inspire further discussion! I, for one, endorse this kind of content along with any thoughtful, intellectual posts. Though, if the community doesn't agree, that is their prerogative."
18caxd,"I say follow your heart. Play what you're inspired to play. If you're inspired to polish a piece, work on that. If you're inspired to just relax and play pieces you already know, do that. The most productive practicing happens when your mind is most concentrated, and when you're inspired by something, your mind is automatically attracted to that thing. I think it's best to take advantage to that phenomenon.I wouldn't bother trying to make numerical rules (e.g. 30 minutes a day, 80% blah blah). You can't quantify the human spirit. Go with your gut."
1596po,"Eternal Darkness.Seriously, it's the best horror game of all time. Only one cheap jump scare, the rest is all atmosphere and the genius insanity gauge and its related effects. Combat that's great for survival horror, fantastic camera, great Cthulhu-inspired mythos, story spanning centuries, awesome spell-making system.There would be so many great grump moments just from the insanity effects alone."
18qqne,"I agree with you - this was my favourite match to watch on the Pro Tour - it was the most (struggling for a word here) ... elegant and inspiring game play.

This might sound weird, but look up a couple of How It's Made episodes on wallets of you can find them. I'm not saying make a wallet like that, but watching them glue in credit card pockets and trim down edges is just inspiring."

188tuu,"Everything in CrossFit is scalable and there are progressions to virtually every exercise. A video I've found particularly inspiring is of a [young girl with cerebral palsy doing CrossFit]( [CrossFit Walter Reed]( works almost exclusively with amputees. The fact, though, is that everyone starts CrossFit with their own limitations and their own strengths. If you give it a try, I think you'll find that your limitations aren't as limiting as you imagine them to be. I do, however, recommend that you find a good trainer to help you work around them."

17ojfq,"Absolutely. It's just a part of my greater fear of the temporal nature of humanity, terrestrial life, and the universe itself. Everything anyone ever did or will do will be forgotten, and that, the true insignificance of out existence, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying."
445m8q,"Just got done reading David Brin's Uplift books, wherein people just use all the different methods at once. Hyperspace jumps, probability drives, shifting into meme-space where you can see the entire universe and just have to find the spot where you want to come out... it's all good, and you just pick whatever method gets you there most easily."
17do2z,"It's simply a better/more unique/more engrossing setting. You can have just about any scenario in 40k, from swordfights to star wars style laser battles to fights against dragons flying in space.

3r4mch,"I love music so much, but I really don't take in the lyrics. It's the how the different sounds work together that makes a piece great to me. A friend gave me an album by a guitarist Andy James. It's metal music but it's all instrumental and it is one of the most fascinating things I've ever heard. Only after I feel the sound I start taking in the lyrics. I'd love to help on a piece of music that can uplift people feeling like we do."

He wrote some of the earliest non-Biblical Christian writings, and was important in the development of the Church's theology (and in proving that certain views existed in the Apostolic Age). His writings are fascinating and inspiring, but also quite gruesome. He talks about his joy at the prospect of being thrown to the lions, as his ground up bones will be the wheat that becomes the pure bread of Christ. I wish I had a small fraction of the willpower he did."
7ktgsf,- the temperature at the equator will barely change because a) meridional heat transport b) in the tropics heat energy is converted to moisture uplift and cooling rainstorms- the temperature deltas in the temperate regions will be more in their winters and their nights - too complicated to explain- above the fiftieth parallel Siberia and Canada will become more livable.

He met dozens of different people ,affected them positively, and left an emotional impact in his wake. However, it's really his quest into Alaska where I feel I lose sympathy for him. He only had relatively basic survival skills and was used to foraging and traveling across the Wilderness of the Continental US. His idea to live in such a frozen climate was fairly stupid considering all of the other great things he achieved."

17oz1z,"I just got past this point as well. As someone with almost the exact same credentials as you seemed to have gathered, I started using sax and guitar, along with some lyrics, and made some pretty legit songs for myself on my computer. What Id suggest to do would be to read good books, believe it or not. It helped me figure out ways to use themes in music, as well as themes within lyrics. I only really felt inspired to do it at around 1 in the morning, but I got up and did it."

And he says that he was the victim of a few hit and runs."

They're designated by a number, like Galactic Seven or GalSeven.

But the Therns also spoke Martian, plus everyone was also sort of telepathic so communication wasn't an issue."

I think I was 7 or 8 when I first read it."

17wsgw,I recommend reading more writer biographies. I always find it inspiring to learn how famous writers got their start in humble beginnings. A lot of great writers seem to have made it because they could not hold down a job doing anything else.Currently I am writing plays which encourages me to become very overwrought and attempt an eloquent bitterness in my writing. I'm not sure if it is working. I fear I am writing a lot of purple prose.

It completely removes the ""skill"" part of playing around with a keyboard and instead lets you focus on composing. At $40 it's also pretty cheap (imo) considering how useful it can be."

2b8xu7,As uplift occurs erosion of higher strata takes place at a faster rate and gets reworked downhill or into the local basin. Over time sediment is broken down into the most stable forms...quartz and clay predominately. New material is eventually entered into the cycle from mantle sources and over geologic time will be broken down and possibly uplifted again to restart the cycle of erosion and deposition.

188xrl,"Life of Pi. Spoiler follows!Basically, it seemed like his mom-- the orangutan--was murdered on the boat while he watch helplessly. In order to keep his faith in god intact he had to invent a story about animals and a magical island.What I took from it was, this story will make you believe in god because god is the only delusion that can disguise the horrors of what people inflict on each other. I argued with a friend over this who thought it was very uplifting."
18ekqv,"MUSIC. You have to know it. You have to have songs you like. Otherwise, it will never become inspiring, you'll just be repeating pre-made steps to a metronome. Who is your favorite artist to dance to?Also, do your steps whenever you hear a beat. Do it in your office for 5 minutes on your break. Do it in line at the grocery store. The more ingrained the basic foot patterns become, the more your mind can think of other things while dancing."

It is the second of the Uplift series."
6d77dq,"I'm really impressed at how woke you are for your age! Tides are changing, to help everyone, we have to uplift everyone without some sort of hidden agenda. Removing Western movies and media like a cancer metastasizing is crucial. There are many Asian media platforms to enjoy, which beat the shallowness of Western media. Be proud, don't be silent when someone is telling an Asian joke or making fun of Asians. Keep up the good work and welcome here!"
6eq8rs,"I do. I frequently have intense periods of lusting and longing for a girlfriend who I can share my life with and who can uplift me. I always have this very whimsical perception of love and relantionships, that it is this state of absolute bliss and euphoria, that all my problem, including depression, will be eleviated the moment a girl embraces me. I often feel that a soulmate is the only thing I truly demand from this world, nothing else."

1625zm,"I actually think the point it makes about social media is less interesting than the way that it mimics TED talks so effectively, from the stunted cadence of his voice to the inspiring music, to the people in the audience.There are plenty of good TED talks, but deconstructing what makes TED talks *feel* so powerful--and how many of those elements are to do with presentation, not substance--helps us guard against letting the presentation overwhelm our skepticism."
16uin6,"The Smiths - Please please please let me get why I wantThe end of the vocals and into the instrumental outro is incredible. The last lyrics ""so for once in my life let me get what I want. Lord knows it would be the first time"" on their own would bring you to tears, but then goes from being a beautiful 12 string acoustic guitar song to everything kicking in. It goes from C to C7 and the most inspired use of a Mandolin solo I've ever heard. Shakes down the spine and a tear in the eye."

Now Adelaide's grand daughter is not going to be inspired to go into space and the human race progresses much slower than it would have if the Doctor didn't save her. This also impacts other planets as Earth wouldn't have done its whole space spiel when Earth had originally. Basically, yes; the Doctor saving Adelaide's life is enough to sound the bell."

The elevator problems could represent not knowing how to uplift yourself toward that goal. The school dreams could then represent in the school of life you still need work, a new area of your learning/growth."

Over time though chinos, snap backs, nba merch began dominating the services till people started focussing more on the worship and what you're really there to do and that's be inspired, to grow etc. If you're a leader in church though, might want to keep at least smart casual just cause. [lecrae]( kinda might help with this."
15wak7,"I've had two ferrets with insulinoma (excuse my spelling) and yes it is heart breaking. I currently have my munkeys as we call them on a grain free low carb kibble as it is not easy for us to keep fresh meat on our boat at all times. I have recently friended a wonderful breeder in Australia who has without her knowing, inspired me to introduce raw meat into my munkey's lives; this thread gives me a little more determination and inspiration.Thank you"
17mnds,"There definitely are commentaries on the Bible written by theologians. We tend not to cite them as evidence for theological arguments because they are not authoritative like the Bible. Scripture is inspired by God while commentaries are not, nor are books written about the Bible. There are some really awesome commentaries that have been written throughout Christian history that are very helpful in unpacking difficult books like Romans and John."

17oxsw,I own a small business and I compete with the big dogs. People will respond to economic pressure not guilt inspiring notes taped to your door!
6eu8ka,"Dogs, as well as other animals, are aware of more subtle emotional variances. We too can become aware of such things. I can not tell you at the moment what those specifics are but generally trying to uplift yourself, your brother, and your dog with healthy activities will help ex.:walking in nature, bonding, creative activities, and a healthy appreciation and outlook on life and the beings living it."
16map0,"My spiritual beliefs in consciousness, vibrations, frequency, realities and the exploration of our own mind accompanied by meditation was something I previously kept hidden from my friends. Fortunately, recently my boyfriend and his two housemates have come to me for tips on starting to meditate and have shown a genuine interest in these concepts. Needless to say it was a great day! The fact that they came to me instead of me trying to cram my beliefs down their throats was the most awe-inspiring event I've experienced in a while"

I just saw Django Unchained yesterday and tons of stuff inspired me. From the creative way the theatre's ""turn your cell phone off"" commercial to the way the type was used in the movie. It's crazy to think, but creative people doing creative things to communicate is all around."

Regard each one , each practice you have done, as very precious. Another strategy is to feel deeply fortunate in regards to what you have going well in your life. This helps uplift the mind. Finally, don't identify with the negative habits- remember, sometimes they are strong, sometimes they are weak-- this shows they are impermanent! If they can change a little , they can change a lot:)"

I brought him in and got it in the net, and go to unhook it, and realize with horror that the lower jaw of the fish is split in half. This wouldn't be terrible, but it was awe-inspiring to see these jaws function separately. I managed to unhook it, and showed it to a friend before releasing it. Quite an interesting catch for me."

1800ce,"No symbolic figure of morality is perfect, but his tendency to do good despite the arcane judgement of the Pharisees does offer an inspiring individualism. Strip out the magic and he's a pretty good symbol, I think. I think Thomas Jefferson did just this in 'The Life and Teachings of Jesus of Nazareth'."

71s7qq,"Advanced civilizations find many things to help along besides space travel. Brin's term is ""uplift,"" and I've seen this broad category of advanced civilizations meddling but in a positive way (in theory at least) referred to as anti-prime-directive SF. Iain M. Banks' novels about The Culture are all in this vein. Also, Doris Lessing's Canopus in Argos series.Someday I will get to reading some of the Strugatsky Borthers' Noon universe stories. Long list here: EDIT: fix link"

One of which came from an abusive home and had been attacked by a dog. It took almost 2 years to love the fear out of him. Both of them are like my furry kids.

2sfkk4,"You should mark your post as possible triggering for other people, just to be on the safe side.I like to listen to happy music or watch a cartoon when i get this feeling. Dextors Lab or invader zim. My little pony works well for me too. Just district yourself from it and it will fade. You're obviously upset, which is making you feel more sad than you really are, so if you can distract yourself, you can give yourself some happy feelings to uplift your spirits."
196s0q,"I think a remake of Extreme G for N64 would be amazing.

15tdoh,"I think the idea that no other faith -- no other school of teaching stems less from doctrine than cultural interpretation. If you look at the end of 2 Nephi 29, it talks about the books that will be inspired in the north and the south, the east and the west. While I think culturally, Mormonism is exclusive -- partially because of outside forces and partially because Mormons tend to be a traditional, conservative community -- but I would argue that the doctrine is very inclusive and open."
89h0ub,"First, reflect on what is going on in your life? Stress? Anxiety? Try to counter-act that by setting aside time for yourself like doing something outside or getting some exercise. Basically, do something different that will uplift your mood. If you’re with your friends, listen to what they’re saying and control yourself and live in the moment. Nobody wants to be around someone negative so try turning things into a positive light! Good luck."

Very inspiring."

When they first launched these formats you were able to edit the CSS directly (with some limitations). In terms of performance, if you don't enable images to serve in addition to the native format you'll likely see a poorer performance. But enable image/text and style them to fit your site and you'll likely see a small uplift in RPM :)Btw, the native formats actually are responsive in the sense that they aren't static sizes."

6vv1i4,"Because the universe is big, VERY big, it is mindnumbingly unimaginably big.There are probably at the very least hundreds of planets similar to earth just in the closest dozen of galaxies around us. (It's hard to tell exactly how populated the universe is from the info we currently have)Ones that are not under the guardianship of Asgard, and a lot of those other worlds are probably also in a much better state to be accepting and ready for a proper uplift."

16jtb0,"I pretty much have the same experiences. Only i dont play music, i draw.Havent tried 2CB yet, but i agree with you that a long and exciting trip really gets me inspired. Especially if i wait a few days, focus on remembering every little detail of the trip and then draw.Also, whenever i chew shrooms, i really get deep in the drawing. Sort of like a trance haha. And i always believe that i have made a masterpiece, when in reality it's just a lot of lines that dont make any sense."

Death has always evaded my mind, but thinking about the end, having a countdown clock...Seems scary, and the fact you don't seem scared is very inspiring!

15vnn9,"The way Shepard says ""I won't let fear compromise who I am"" was just so powerful it resonated with me throughout playing ME3 especially as she was forced to loosen her morals a bit I always felt like she constantly wondered whether she did the right thing or not now that she's faced with the reapers face to face and everyone is dieing (I know the choice doesn't matter but playing in a vacuum Shep doesn't know that).

16oq8z,"Grizzly Bear's album ""Veckatimist"". I listened to this on a cid trip and it was so beautiful--it also gets a little scary in each song but then the song will change and be really uplifting and pretty"
3fnraz,"It depends on what you like to do and what gets you in that despondent state.For me, I had to quit drinking 100%. I also have to keep up with my dancing/exercise, or somehow be active, otherwise I easily get lethargic.I also keep up with my spiritual practice, meditation, and hobbies. So, it's really up to you. Make a list of the things you love, that just uplift you, and stay away from those things that don't."
17mqn9,"Count me in as another person inspired by this post. I am 29 and have always been too apprehensive to try to start this late.

2o0cst,Well I've read:Ringworld series which is not bad by Larry Niven and his Mote in gods eye series is a good read as well.Ilium and olympos by Dan Simmons and his hyperion series. Both are good but the ilium and Olympos books have some slow areas but still worth the read.Enders game universe by orson Scott card are a great read.Uplift series by David Brin there are 6 books in two trilogy's and I defiantly like the first set better.Foundation/robots/empires series by Asimov are a nice read also.
329dl8,I think if they came across humans as we are now they would uplift us.

161br6,I used PHAT last summer. Go for it!!!I had a summer job which allowed me to eat pre prepared meals all day and go gym 5 days/week. Me and a friend adopted PHAT (inspired by layne norton of course) for 3 MONTHS STRAIGHT.I gained alot of muscle and strength. I think i went from 82kg to 90 kg and all my lifts exploded. notice the capital letters - consistency is key. Stay consistent and it will work wonders. Prepare for some serious DOMS...

I just wanted to let you know that you guys rock and that Tim and Luke inspired me to get better at guitar.I just wish I could have told you that when I saw you in the parking lot before the show.

28zpij,"&gt; I believe the art of DJing is not just about hyping up the crowd and keeping the night goingI feel the exact opposite. My job is basically to get people laid, not to give them a once-in-a-lifetime unforgettable experience that will uplift them to new emotional heights or whatever."
18j8n6,"weirdest yet best meal you had?If you could give anyone in the world a piece of your mind, who would it be?Cause i'm to lazy to look what you said to deva: What is your nickname inspired by?and just for you: how long have you been drawing?"
16s77z,"I read in the book ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" that people learn more quickly and are more inspired if they are playing on an instrument they love and are proud of. My experience tracks this perfectly. If you're a committed musician the time to buy a good guitar is ""as soon as possible"". Don't forget to include some money for a good setup though. It usually helps a tremendous amount with the playability, which means you'll enjoy playing it even more and you'll progress more quickly."

1848vc,AwesomeHere is an awesome video. I say this if you like games. Watch this YouTube series and be inspired when it comes to gaming.
189dsq,"So glad that my blog inspired you! The only downside I see to that Gilmore Girls list is that, because the show hasn't been on in some years, it misses out on some great recent stuff. I'd supplement it with some new stuff, and you'll be the best-read reader ever.I'm working my way through the Booker Prize winners and the Hard Case crime books. That means I get to alternate between seriously beautiful stuff and gritty depraved stuff. A balanced diet!"

171veh,"I visualize writing rules as the exercises a ballerina does until the dance moves are so much part of her body that she no longer has to think about them to perform. At that point, she is inspired and so good that she can break the rules and it no longer matters."
15jye3,The scene in the tunnel from The Blind Banker definitely gave me a Batman-like vibe. Inspiration mimicking the inspired I suppose.

167ovf,"The thing with the Bible is that there are tons of people who have read it, but can't recite a single word. I love the section i Ezekiel where God raises the dead and dry bones. Isaiah 61 is my mission statement, and Luke 15 helped me more with my understanding of the Gospel more than anything else i've ever read. the entire book of James turned my world upside down, and it's interesting how Revelation seems so unoriginal because you read the things that are inspired by Revelation first before reading Revelation first. the Bible's fascinating."
18wkfd,Neither! We should read the bible as a deep text full of meaning and try our best to understand it. Because (if you believe it to be a divine/divinely inspired text) the curtains are never just blue.
183vv8,I was never inspired to make a animated gif before. Until today that is:I was sitting around with my kids when for what ever reason we got on a kick looking up songs/videos that they liked when they were wee-ones. This Thomas the Train song was a big hit and as soon as I saw this part of the video I knew I had to make something out of it!

170j68,"If I could have one thing and one thing only it would be a 64bit version of Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. That game has helped forged some great friend ships, inspired a drinking game or two, and caused the odd punch in the face when ""gentleman"" agreements have been broken. Really appreciate the games you guys put out and am looking forward to your future projects and wish you all the best."
16m45h,Your successes are inspiring. It's not just for your son. It's not just for you. Everyone with a similar story is somehow involved in this with you. Thanks for writing.
18pik4,"You have inspired so many people and certainly made space exciting again. Certainly many of us could never even conceive of the adventure you are on. I was wondering 1) if you will retire after this? 2)if you don't what will be your encore 3)if you are retiring how do you see your life post space? I think you have a lot to offer to the space program, to science but mostly to the citizens of tomorrow. Thoughts?"
17fj8e,"This seems to be a strongly biased start to a ""debate"". I have no wish to enter into a ""debate"" with one so strongly and unilaterally biased. I enjoy reading the Book of Mormon, whether cover-to-cover or otherwise. I have gained valuable insights into myself and the gospel from its text.For the sake of discussion, however, how about a common starting point? Let's define terms. How do you evaluate whether something is ""inspired""?"
18bop6,"For a KS-route-esque romance story, there's May Sky.Great soundtrack, touching, light-hearted and uplifting story, great heroine, endearing chemistry between protagonists...I really liked May Sky. It was nothing revolutionary, pretty short, but it did what it tried to do superbly. Its a simple story, but a *really* nice, earnest at that."
17j08y,"I gotta say, there's something that makes me smile when I watch someone like Bdubs puzzling through and trying to make something with redstone. It's one thing to watch Doc or Etho or any other redstoner make something amazing or bizarre or awe-inspiring with it, but it's something else entirely to watch someone who's never used much redstone get an idea in their head and actually manage to get it to work how they want in the end."
16mq0g,"YES! You're back! I was seriously bummed yesterday when I missed your AMA.You've been my hero since childhood and you inspired me to get into bodybuilding, which in turn developed my confidence. In short you helped turn a shy tiny Asian kid into someone who is now confident and LOVES life! THANK YOU.Question: Is there any one lesson or idea or book that you would recommend for someone wanting to achieve the kind of success that you've had in life?"
16hdfn,Maybe you could start making friends that inspire you and that you can learn from. I learned a few things just by hanging around my Christian friends by just watching the way they act (more so how to be a gentleman). But perhaps you could make some friends that are more mature than you that you can be comfortable enough with to ask questions.Finding friends isn't easy. Maybe you can start getting into meetups or something similar.

I'd love some uplifting links about our city.Obesity IS a real problem in our country, but I really don't see any proof (like Chaosrains said) that we are anywhere near the ""fattest"" city. This makes me sad."
zzp3x,"I've been so inspired by the strong female characters in the WoT universe. If anything, Egwene's strength has inspired me to be as strong, determined, and resilient as she is. Egwene is the only book character to have inspired me to be a better person."
18oni6,"When I was a teen I once dreamed that my grandma (that IRL was the sweetest person ever) and grandpa (who IRL died when I was 4) had a secret room under their house that they used to butcher people. I went outside into the back yard and found her helping him perform a vivisection on a pregnant woman. I was like ""Woah, grandpa's alive! Neat."" and proceeded to help clean up the floor and walls around them while they ""worked"". Strange dream, but it did inspire a great short story."

18bhme,"Dear Mr. Gates, What is the basic reasoning behind starting up the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation, rather than just partnering up with one of the many other already existing philanthropic foundations with the same goals?

16th9y,"The new Quartz blocks are amazing, and I would suggest trying building with those, they have inspired a lot of people with builds lately, also there is a new redstone block that is a nice red block, but also acts as a redstone torch that is movable with pistons, so if you are into redstone there are a few thing that are cool to use. Other than that, I would suggest checking out the WIKI, because there has been a lot of stuff added in the past few months, and everyone has different aspects that they enjoy about the updates."
16fgi6,"Not sure if this is appropriate -- I feel a bit like I'm exploiting the situation with this suggestion -- but I feel compelled to say that if you're feeling inspired by Aaron's liberation of paywalled scientific papers, and you have university access to expensive journal subscriptions, then I might suggest heading on over to /r/scholar and filling some requests."

1vcdos,"Art, and that includes, drawings, stories, writings, music, and all other artistic stuff that's good enough to kill my boredom and uplift my soul. As for the music that I like, Jin (Shizen no Teki-P) is at the top of my list, and I do love songs with catchy tunes and an inspiring messages. Oh, and helping people improve themselves and inspiring other people to become better and happy also relaxes me and makes me feel more peaceful, too!"

1668t8,"It can be. Art with an open brief and no restraints can be very daunting for some, myself included. With pixel art you have very clearly defined limitations and having to produce work within them can actually be very freeing and even inspiring.You can use whatever you produce as a basis to build off and you might even work up to bigger pieces in future.The most important thing is just to start and keep trying. If you're anything like me your initial work will probably be weak as hell so just keep at it."

18sx1b,"The best part of Spotify is that they host many re-releases that have lots of bonus tracks. And a lot of the Bowie bonus tracks are amazing. I just can't imagine how this guy could write such amazing songs that didn't make a proper album. Or he could give away songs to other bands, like Mott the Hoople, that eventually became their greatest hit.It's awe-inspiring."
16v6nv,"Not necessarily anarchist, but PLEASE check out Endgame by Derrick Jensen. Really inspiring (for me at least anyway). Also, not to be the typical primmie, but Ishmael by Daniel Quinn is also not necessarily anarchist but awesome. John Zerzan obz is pretty cool 2.

161vmf,"In my opinion the missing piece for Oklahoma football since 2001 is not on offense, it's to have another player such as Roy Williams at db. That guy simply inspired FEAR like no other for the other teams receivers to try and go over the middle. And it wouldn't hurt to have another Rocky Calmus either.Oklahoma is not getting killed by its offense, it's getting killed by the defense giving up big plays at bad times, and it has been that way for a while."

22v4bt,"As /u/deacondorniels mentioned: A Deepness in the Sky and A Fire Upon the Deep, both by Vernor Vinge. Read them. They are what you are looking for.And /u/feefnarg is undeniably correct about the Uplift universe (6 books). That series (for the most part) is precisely what you are looking for, though I think the two books mentioned above, by Vernor Vinge, are superior.Anvil of Stars (sequel to the The Forge of God) by Greg Bear is also worth the read.The Algebraist by Iain M. Banks."

17kam0,Thank you so much for your inspiring words. They came to me at the perfect time. I'm currently taking time off from college to grapple with my own definition of success in order to make decisions about my life that will truly make me happy in a deeper more meaningful way. Sometimes it's very difficult to separate what is really meaningful from what is superficial. Your interview just reinforced to me how much art is an essential part of that sorting process. I think your work is beautiful and very real. I can certainly relate to it a whole lot.
15t81i,"To be honest, the story of [Guoliang Tunnel] ( reminded me powerfully of the inspiring story of [Dasharath] ( [ Manjhi] ( who took a chisel to a mountain for [22] ( years and completed a road to his village.

When I was having health problems I identified with Eowyn - “But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking, and the walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in?"" I felt trapped, myself, and Eowyn's eventual freedom and victory were cathartic. Same deal with Superman... I was climbing out of a deep depression and I was inspired by the idea that someone could be genuinely selfless and uncompromisingly moral and also have awesome superpowers."
1793v1,This is beautiful and inspiring. I will watch this every day as fuel to make my dreams become reality
17pkqe,Thank you for posting this! Being new to Reddit it's so exciting to see stories like these and see how a community can change people's lives for the better. I hope I can find the right place to feel as inspired as you were.
15splo,I love to get inspired via video before I go out and play.
195ojk,"Boogie, You are the best. Very inspiring and i love watching your videos, helping me get through this experience called life. Thanks a bunch."
6egitp,"I'm a big fan of the cannop cycle center at the forest of Dean. A bit of everything trail wise (from easy xc to tough DH), and an uplift service you don't have to book a million years in advance. The DH runs aren't that long, but there are quite a lot of them."
17no0w,"I'm a nurse now but at this point I was still a kid in high school. My brother got really sick with what we thought was a staph pneumonia and I didn't get to hear it but I remember my parents told me his last conscious words before he entered the ambulance was ""I'm sorry I put you through all this."" Those words help inspire and boost me to become the nurse I am today."
1904tf,"Awesome, I love, just absolutely love, the different kinds of people reddit has shown me. You of them all. I want to be a musician that can play like you one day, amazing but laid back. I have been playing for 10 years now and I am only 14, people like you inspire me to keep going. Thanks, you definently deserve the gig!"
16rev9,"This will probably sound lame to some people, but the utter chaos and sand-papery sound of (old) Skinny Puppy, [especially on the Rabies]( record. It's all the little things and samples in the tunes that inspire me. Some ingenious use of a flanger effect (I think) on [Rivers]("
173ifp,Well done my friend it's really inspiring reading all these posts on here. It's great that you can sit with your friends and not smoke. I'm on day 3 now it's been hell so far I'm not eating or sleeping and I'm very down. It's just nice to see that There are loads of others in the same boat who are coping and sharing stories. I'm 42 I've been smoking weed for 27 years now I really really want to quit this time. Good luck
16184g,"Hi, and welcome to RAoA! Would you like to play a game? I'm having a contest for folks who have never been gifted. All you have to do is write a letter back to your home planet (because you're an alien) about an item on someone else's wishlist. [Letters from the Earth]( inspired by Mark Twain.And welcome to your new addiction!"
184lj0,"It took me a week to feel it, and a month to see results. I was 82kg but went down to 70kg by pure running, dieting, and dedication. I am this weight now after training continuously and am maintaining it. Here is a quote that inspired me:&gt;I ran and ran and ran every day, and I acquired this sense of determination, this sense of spirit that I would never, never give up, no matter what else happened."
162n9o,Awesome! You're the master...remember that. You're an inspiration..over a year is awe-inspiring. Keep it up!
16z9w2,"If you want to be a writer, you need to lose the idea of 'inspiration'. If you can't write right now because you're not 'inspired', you'll most likely never be a professional writer.Beginner writers often complain they're not 'inspired'. Maugham made fun of this by saying : ""I write only when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp.""Shut up, stop complaining and write."
16nzbd,"The Drenai series is great. Gemell is one of my favorites, and I agree with SandSword that he is often ignored, overlooked, or looked down on. And yet, I have never gone wrong recommending the man to a fantasy reader.Gemell is a master of heroic fantasy. His series are fun, and have an indescribable uplifting quality to them, for me at least. His side works, like Echoes of the Great Song and Knights of Dark Reknown remain some of the best out there.I miss him so."
16r5v6,"Wow, that's some great hustle on your part. What type of workout are you doing? Some lifting like squats, deads, and other compound movements, or are you talking more of a yoga and spinning type workout?For what it's worth, you're smoking hot and have gorgeous eyes. Terrific and inspiring work."
4d2hbj,"Ethos: Fanatic Individualist, XenophileGovernment: Indirect DemocracyTraits: Nomadic, Charismatic, Weak, Fast BreederBreed like Rabbits, make migration treaties with every race possible. Find and uplift one of those ""genetically modified hyper-gorilla super soldier"" races. Invade neighbors with gorillas. With the planets flooded with our weak population, they'll stand no chance...yet easily re-integrate into our empire."
16b2qc,"The difference between the bible being the ""word of god"" and ""inspired by god"". If the latter, it can have some communication problems. But it allows you to evade any serious problems with cognitive dissonance. However the former absolves you of personal responsibility for following the bible literally. The latter does not do so because it is your own personal interpretation you are following and you alone are responsible for that."
185xdl,"Mr Grohl...I've been drumming for 22 years...and you sir are one of my personal heros...from your dislike of certain genres ""ruining music"" to your rising above your art and expanding past the drums...I remember listening to a bootleg of ""marigold"" 20 years ago and being inspired to try singing and picking up the guitar...my question is...which do you live the most? Layin Down chops or licks?"
18u39h,"So lovin the new album!! It's too hard picking a favorite song as the lyrics you lay down are so intriguing and beautiful. In the song ""yesterday, yesterday, I got giddy hearing the verse and I hope I am hearing it correctly ""mineapolis will be gone, dead for dreaming in the rain, with all the guilt but without the pain..."" I love hearing my city in a song and I relate to this verse somehow. Were all the song written on Wishbone, written this past year (2012)? You always inspire me!"
5svnpi,"Find ways to uplift yourself, dude. Really use your musical talent as an outlet. If there's anything else creative that you do, pursue that more as well. And remember that it's okay to walk away from any situation even if you just need a minute to recollect/recompose yourself.Living well is the best revenge."
1pkwgp,Newer Authors similar to Asimov1. David Brin The Uplift Series2. John Scalzi Old Mans War3. Alastair Reynolds Revelation Space series4. Larry Niven alone is awesome Books of known space5. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle are incredible books
1yrq7g,"Yep I'm definitely feeling the same thing. I was angry for no reason at all today, but I didn't give in, and I am so thankful for that. I appreciate hearing that someone else felt the same way I did today haha. Thanks for the uplift!"
15ra3e,"Hey fellow Redditor,You inspire me. Keep on keeping on. You can do it man. You've made it so far, keep going."
182bmy,Way to go. It's very inspiring to hear from guys as they are pulling their lives together. Thanks so much for sharing.edit: corrected here to hear.
2rcjje,"As a food-source, I'd only use them as a last reserve. Like those edible leafs you can scavenge, they don't rot. So you can store them for quite a while. But I'd save them for bird-traps and fishing. Vegetable-stew is damn nutritious and if you use leftovers from veggies for traps, the occasional vermin+veggie-stew should uplift your mood. Never really had food-issues in PZ. Never played with ultra-rare loot though."
18bapu,"Wow, the difference 34 lbs makes. Your gf is smokin' &amp; she inspired you to get healthy. Hold on to that one. Great job, both of you."
15thah,"If you make it up to Seattle, message me or something. I just wanted to say that the fact you're just getting out is really inspiring. Safe travels, my friend."
18gaqy,"Being 'unhappy' about something is not the way to change and fix it. If you see benefits to changing and fixing an aspect of yourself and your life, then do so. You don't have to be unhappy to do it. In fact if you are inspired and excited about change it is likely to stick better, in my opinion."
177f96,It's nice to hear these kind of stories.They inspire courage in all of us.
18agp7,"Scale The Summit is hands-down my favorite instrumental band, and my favorite band in general. They're far more in the progressive realm, but most of their songs are incredibly uplifting. More instrumental bands I like:* Pelican* Animals As Leaders* Spaces* Cloudkicker* If These Trees Could Talk* T.R.A.M.* Chimp SpannerThese final two are nothing like the rest at all, they both write old-school hip hop beats with glitchy sounds and voice clips thrown in, no rapping. I enjoy them a great deal, some of you may also:* Prefuse 73* Dabrye"
17m285,The really awe inspiring thing is to look at this and realize that people used to see stuff like this in *much* more detail. It's not hard to imagine why people were so fascinated with the stuff in the night sky when you see it even a little bit how they saw it.
176yyt,My dancing this morning was inspired by me getting an awesome new job offer!
18w1jz,Anything by Desiderii Marginis (Dark ambient drone music) is great background music for dungeon crawlers &amp; Lovecraft inspired games.
1nknqb,"David Brin's Uplift series. Sometimes it's nice to dream that we'll be able to take part in something greater than ourselves, and the galactic civilization is just that."
18t3qd,"I was inspired by a skeptic who was contacted by a woman who claimed to be in contact with intelligent supercomputers from the future. The skeptic told the woman to ask these supercomputers to factor a large random integer. Of course ""they"" couldn't do it and she was cured of her delusion.So my ambition would be to convince someone to go on a DMT trip - or to go on one myself- armed with a large random integer and ask any ""intelligences"" they meet to factor it. Any takers?"
17uptf,"The Hornblower books by C. S. Forester are fantastic. They're about the journey of a British Royal Navy officer, who is slowly promoted through the ranks. It's set around 1800, and have also been adapted into a television series starring Ioan Gruffudd. ^^I ^^own ^^the ^^box ^^set.They are basically the first books of its type. They inspired the Sharpe novels, Patrick O'Brian's novels, and interestingly, according to the wikipedia page, Captain James T. Kirk and Captain Jean-Luc Picard."
249f8v,"Haha, excellent drawing.Anyway, I think it's time you read [some David Brin](In Uplift, Neo-Dolphins have ""walkers"", robotic exoskeletons with four (?) legs and two arms, which are controlled via a USB port in their head. In the books, they're mostly in space (swimming around in oxygenated water on board their ship) or in the sea on an alien world. I could definitely see them walking around on Earth, trying to flirt with bikini-clad ladies and getting into trouble."
1723yy,"Iain Banks' Culture novels. A society/economy based on plenty, instead of scarcity as ours are, and The Culture doesn't really do the Prime Directive thing. They interfere to try to stop cruelty and injustice. Makes for good conflict, as they see consequences of interfering are not always a happy outcome. Love David Brin's Uplift series, Gregory Benford's books, Vernor Vinge, Frank Herbert, many others, but in forty plus years of reading SF, Banks is my favorite author at this time."
2pfz2w,"Two Betrayals because of the awesome music (Undercover of Night) and the way you see the flood tear the covenant that landed on the ring apart.Metropolis because... The Scarab I guess.Halo (H3) because it has fantastic music, and the Warthog run at the end is awesome. The best part of Halo 3.Uplift Reserve because your mom.New Alexandria because it's cool and stuff.Midnight because of the broadsword flying, the linear but still very fun corridors and the music (117 and Arrival)"
16bq23,This is so inspiring. Much like you - weight has been a strugle for the majority of my life. I've done the yo-yoing a few times. The last year i've been fighting to correct my emotional eating and it's been one hell of a fight for me. Stories like yours remind me I'm not alone and that i Can do this - i just have to keep fighting for it. Thank you so much for sharing. :)
16noko,My favorite drink is a Margarita!!! I love them! I try every one that I can get my hands on. My favorite is peach. Here is my Margarita inspired manicure!
16vg07,"I just want you to know that this post has inspired me to be alot more ambitious with my life, and stop being bitter about such an amazing gift.I wish you the best from one human being to another, and its great to hear that the years of treatment have been good. Godspeed"
1guwap,"The way I see it, the things that uplift us should also convict us, and the things that convict us should also uplift us. I just think it takes a blessed perspective to teach a congregation to see what you're preaching in a way that serves both needs"
16fa9v,cyclone hull... it inspired me to train a leadership character for command ships.
16bq23,"This is so amazing and inspiring. I keep telling others who've never had to do something like this that it's a mind game. You've given a lot of people here strength, hope and conviction. (I know it's not just me.)Added you to my friends. (Also, your costumes are phenomenal.)"
4iajel,"[The Uplift Saga]( by David Brin has this in spades. The [Traeki/Jophur]( are my favoite. Sundiver, the first book, is more of a prequel and a lot of people (me included) feel it is his weakest book, so feel free to simply read the synopsis if you aren't drawn in.[Six Worlds Yonder]( by Eric Frank Russell (part of a Ace Double which includes The Space Willies as well) is about a spaceship exploring alien planets. It's light and fun."
16dswy,"There isn't. It's like saying ""You're too fat"" and ""You are oversized"".To further clarify: Every musician gets inspired. Technically no new notes are created and the only difference is how they put them together and what instrument they use to play their music. So the core is always the same.Imagine Books. You don't reinvent the language, you only put the words in a different order to create a new story. Still, you wouldn't claim that the latest Thriller was inspired by the bible just because you have a few latin words in it."
18vq7v,It takes a lot of courage to do what he did. Really inspiring.
15sw2t,"I think the problem with this question is that asking who is the best president, is almost equal to asking ""Who's been our greatest president?""And that's the catch - we never had a 'great' president. In a strict definition, it's supposed to be someone who has everything - inspiring/charismatic, intelligent, incorruptible, and lifted the country to greater heights.So maybe we can break down this question a bit by answering who's the best in each of these attributes?1) Most Inspiring/Charismatic - was supported by a great majority of the people2) Most Intelligent3) Most Honest - incorruptible4) Greatest Achievement as a president"
175s68,"The game Brett Favre played the day after his fathers death. Some of those plays the offense were making were just awe inspiring. 399 yards and 4 TD's. I was in tears after the game. It was such a great thing to see a man play the game he loves to that high of a level the day after something like that happens. Say what you want about Brett, but damnit you have to respect what he did on the field that night."
17qakh,"I'm a big fan. You inspired alot of my own musical creations. Without you, along with many other musicians within my childhood, I would have never picked up a guitar. I will try to overcome my star-struck amazement while I think of an appropriate question to ask...P.S. As easy as Everlong sounds... it is not as easy to play, how you can play it and sing is beyond me."
5tpv9q,"There are always people, usually the ignorant and uneducated, that will reject change in any form. Unfortunate for them, the wheels are already in motion and in a free market/economy this innovation can't be stopped. Especially so considering the uplift in productivity/profits automation promises to bring, businesses/people that reject it will simply fall behind."
1729k8,"I'm 46 and pretty well jaded, but I have to say that your Storytellers appearance was very moving and inspiring, and you made at least one lifelong fan just from that show. Thanks for all the beautiful things you create."
15ugnj,"I almost alwyas start from the rhythm,I like to know the "" when"" of things, that makes the "" what"" that much easier. The Rhythms of things inspire me."
193p3z,"Oh my gawsh. This has inspired me to try and write poems/spoken word.This project spoke huge volumes to me. I love how Shane explains how everyone loves the underdog - because everyone is the underdog! :')Everyone has been called those names, been made self conscious about the way they interact with the world - everyone is the underdog because we all ""stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called"". Thanks for sharing this with me! It made me really think about stuff :)"
18bhme,Who or what inspired you to create such an amazing company and give back so much to worthy causes?
172swh,"I'd use the relationship between Plato and slavery. A slave is an 'abstracted human', a human ripped out of his social context. Without his context, he appears like a platonic Ideal. Thus the social context inspiring platonic idealism."
16ycse,Very inspiring! Having control of my desires is definitely one of the things I'm looking to achieve along this process.
17ls63,Holy crap what an inspiring post! You really refreshed in my mind a lot of things I take for granted and I got all thankful all over again just reading through it.Congrats and nice job but more than that thanks for taking the time to share what its all meant to you.
18fz9i,"Many years ago my dad had kidney disease and both of his kidneys failed as a result. His sister donated a kidney without any hesitation. Thanks for saving my dad's life Aunt Diane.I know it wasn't exactly done for me, but it has absolutely affected me as it taught me the values of sacrifice and inspired me to become a blood &amp; organ donor."
17t4ar,"(24 yo F/150 lbs) I got hit by a car while biking a few months ago, and my progress back in the gym has been slow and sometimes really discouraging. I'd always been kind of intimidated by the bar and so always stuck to the dumbbell chest press, but today (after getting inspired by a lot of r/fitness posts) I benched the bar for the first time! I also did a 280 calf raise and upped how much I lifted in every exercise. Definitely the best feeling I've had after a workout since my accident."
17fj8x,I found this letter to be somewhat inspiring.Reddit post to follow.
2ybxbs,"Hey now, let us keep each other in prayer. Help others pray too, and let us help one another and uplift one another in prayer."
17krsa,"yes, to every generation comes a show that speaks to those people. there was ""archie bunker, cheers, and the shows you mention"" there's a generation of people who are just like you, inspired by those shows, and will make one for themselves. the weird part, you might be the generation that gets it, or you may be out of cultural sync."
29brig,"Hi DrGrey17. Thanks for posting. A bit of advice I can give you is don't stress about looking for the benefits. Instead us that time free of PMO to build yourself up. Read uplifting books, exercise, start a good hobby that you can meet good people with. All those things help uplift you and make you feel better in which you start to see the benefits. Hang in there and PM me if you ever need some help. Best of luck friend."
175lwl,"We called it again. r/exmormon truly is inspired. God truly is with us.(No, I didn't call it, someone else did)"
189e4q,Probably the scenes of Yuzuru's past in Angel Beats! since they inspired me to sign up for organ donation and helped me achieve a much better lifestyle.
163ymf,If you like music - All Saints in Pasadena (Episcopal) is really great and the Pastor is very forward thinking and inspiring.
17c8qf,You don't need to have patience. You likely just need to look at things around you as connected to each other. Meditating helps this. It is inspirational and really helps inspire the imagination.
16bskd,"**Jimi Hendrix**He seems so much more than the sum of his influences. Genuinely expressive player. Genuine pioneer of guitar sounds.And as much as people copy him, he seems to have also inspired people to go off on their own and find their own sound. I'm still surprised by his playing whenever I listen to it."
18c266,Lots of the New Wave movement is heavily drug / philosophical / transcendence inspired.... Silverberg's Son of Man (1971)Lot's of PKD's works as many have pointed out....Etc. I do think it's a rather nebulous type of subgenre...
18ud48," We have a ""wall of shame"", a bulletin board on which we post photos of nightmare computers. This includes malicious software reports, physical problems like extreme dust, cobwebs and roach infestation. The ""Wall of Shame"" is posted on the shop wall with a brief comment . This practice has inspired customers to practice due diligence when cleaning their computer hardware."
16qkyg,[The Hug Lady]( because my dad's military but I don't get way into the crying when he comes home thing. And [Seconds]( because it's inspiring.
15s03o,"Green Lantern. He inspired me to be a man who does things for good. The right thing. No matter what tough situation he is put in, he finds a way to clear it up and solve it. He stands for justice, and he is what I hope to be like when I hope to achieve my dreams of being a Private Investigator."
18la6c,"While playing Detective/Police type games like Noir: Killer vs. Inspector or Police Precinct, I recommend leaving this [site]( on. It pairs ambient music with actual radio chatter and gives off that feeling like you're in a Michael Mann film.For games like Netrunner or Shadowrun, I like to pair them with 80's inspired electronic music. Some of my favorite tracks: [Futurisma]( [Sanctuary]( and [Streets of 2043]("
16waae,"That is amazing!! I am inspired to make one similar, but with velcro on the letters, to play scrabble at a campfire or in bed, or even the car!"

The Resurrected (The Case of Charles Dexter Ward),The Unnamable,Dreams in the Witch House,Dunwich Horror,DagonThere are many very good Lovecraft inspired films which I can also recommend.John Carpenter's The Thing,Stephen King's The Mist,Cabin in the Woods,Evil Dead (I, II, and Army of Darkness),From Beyond,Re-Animator"
1e76v9,"Uplift, by David Brin. It's set in a universe where Uplift is the norm, but Humanity's uplift is uncertain. The first (Stardiver) has the most to do with it, as the next lot are more to do with the effects of humanity genetically uplifting chimps and dolphins."
6bd3m7,Thanks so much for the help we just had a fair like for the people amd prayer to try to uplift them me and my husband and youngest daughter cooked and served the people it was amazing... Sending many prayers for those in the path of the hurricane

179rks,"Yes! Your work has just helped me realize how to bust out of a rut I've been in with my own work. I've been working on a series of ""Cosmos"" paintings (inspired by Carl Sagan's book and PBS TV series) but the paintings needed a little bit of extra inspiration that you just provided.Thank you!"
19466z,God. Damn. Inspiring.I'll never start a lawnmower the same way again.
18cjlp,I just want to say that you've inspired me to start reading my copy of Capital. :D
177b17,"[The Voluntary Life]( I really enjoy this one, Molyneux inspired it is but not dependent on all of those ideas.Also, when I had to walk a lot, I would just download Mises series lectures. I used to just throw a few on every morning, and I would highly recommend Hulsmann and Salerno on economics for two people from around now, Murphy and French to a lesser extent, and Robert LeFevre for philosophy type stuff. Or just download seminars at a time."
15ygo5,"It's exactly when you're not worried about injuries that you get injured.It's exactly when you're ""inspired"" by something like a book that you might push your body too hard without your mind registering it until too late.The runner's worst enemy isn't any inability to run more miles sooner. It's injury. Be cautious, work up slowly. You can be a great runner, and have a blast. You're no Tarahumara, though. You're you. Be careful with you."

1812g1,Ventriloquist (similar to how he was done in the City of Scars fan film) and David Tennant's SAW films inspired Riddler.
17zu9n,Clearly you're unaware of the network of science geek night clubs dotting the urban landscape. They gather together to dance to the sounds of very longwave radio ( while the powerpoint charts from nearby science conferences are randomly flashed on the walls
16gv6x,"after watching Ray Lewis' after game interview, I don't think he can speak and not inspire, I'm sure I'd shed a tear listening to him order Mcdonalds."
16mb92,"Everything about architecture amazes me, especially when I'm walking downtown in Chicago. I'm sure there are theoretically more interesting things, but I find few things more awe-inspiring than a well put together building. Like, if I were a time traveler that would be the first thing to really hit me because you don't even need to explain anything about it."
18ycf5,"Dude, this is inspiring. I've wanted to do the same thing since I got my bike. What kind of riding gear did you bring (rain suit?), and how much was it all?"
16xepq,"The idea is that the men are simply the agency used by God. Divinely inspired, so to speak. But yes, it is also indistinguishable from ""they wrote it""."
18bhme,"Bill you are amazing. I don't have a question for you and I'm not too worried about how you made your fortune. How you spent it, though, is truly an inspiration. Your eternal kindness and charity have inspired me to move to Africa and do things that are out of my comfort zone, but beneficial to humanity. I just wanted to say thank you. You are a wonderful person."
7v5wu9,"I really enjoyed [The Moon and the Other]( explorations of humanity/gender issues/science, and I love his prose. [Station 11]( is post-apocalyptic, and it reads almost like an elegy. Just spectacular writing. David Brin's [Uplift series]( takes place in a lot of different places, and I found both the exploratory themes and the love of various planets to be very positive."

196c67,"If Raiden went through Shadow Moses as rendered in Twin Snakes, wouldn't he have instantly recognized Plissken was Snake? He went through a simulator of the situation at Shadow Moses more than the explicit details we got in the game. They wouldn't simulate things like the relationship with Meryl or even Otacon, just the tactical aspects.The people who will hate the game will continue to hate and no justification will change that, but in the end, it doesn't change any of the canon and it's just got a couple of Matrix-inspired Yeah Right bits thrown in."

17ahbg,it's like Marc Jacobs Marc Jacobs made by Marc Jacobs inspired by Marc Jacobs Marc Jacobs
5r4hxi,"If you are talking about the first Uplift Trilogy itself, beginning with ""Startide Rising"" then it is a great series, and I think this is the best starting point. The previous book chronologically is ""Sundiver"" and it is more a standalone story set in the same universe.""Startide Rising"" features uplifted dolphins, who are part of the crew of the Starship ""Streaker."" These dolphins are part of the Earthclan which includes humans and uplifted apes. The Uplift Series really is a fascinating alien universe, with lots of aliens of many nonhuman types."
1903jw,A game inspired by Digimon (my childhood) in where you start by choosing a partner and growing with it and talking to it and evolving together and by not treating it well it turns against you and your character turns to depression although by treating it well it gets deleted defending you and gets reborn stronger than the first time.Wow that was long well I hope that you dont hate me or want to kill me or suffocate me or even more...
15tt1x,There's no formula.Either drums or tweaking synth patches until there is something interesting to inspire a track.
17tiuf,Aurora's elite play on both ends of the field is inspiring!
18pik4,Hi Commander Hadfield from the UK!My family and I love your Twitter updates; my eldest son is 5 and crazy about science and space. We are all going to Houston soon and will be visiting the NASA Space Centre. But what else would you recommend to visit whilst we're there? Where's your favourite place to eat and what's your favourite food?Thanks for helping to inspire a generation of junior scientists!
8gzf6w,"I've been fortunate to have 62 years to plant a garden\-full of uplifting memories. But the beauty and uplift of the flowers always are in contrast with the surrounding dirt: fear, anxiety, hopelessness. So, after 62 years, I cannot remember any considerable time of contentment, satisfaction, peace.Those three filling most of a life, however, may be approaching for the first time. I am most fortunate, thanks to a lot of help and a new situation."
6jiwl6,"I personally try to advocate to friends and colleagues if someone says something disparaging about someone, and will do my best personally to uplift them in ways that I'm able to. That being said, you have a right to feel safe, and if you don't, then don't feel obliged to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable."
8f06v2,"Villain, in the sense that I'll break about every rule if I feel it's necessary to accomplish my goals.Hero in the sense I tend to want to help others uplift themselves."
15uil4,Congrats! I just finished as well (although the program unfortunately did not help me lose weight - but I'm still going). I'm so inspired by everyone on this forum.
18cn6w,The Creatures are my main reason for starting. They inspire me a lot and I find entertaining others the most rewarding thing in life. I am suffering right now in life but every time I put out a video I become happier knowing at least one person watches my videos. I love doing it and I won't stop.
16duj6,"Way back when, my high school choir performed many of your pieces. My favorite will always be Lux Aurumque. Our conductor absolutely loved your work. He inspired us to look into your other works, and I just wonder if you enjoy going to concerts and listening to your work. Also, do you consider conductors who put their spin on a piece to be messing with it, or think that everyone puts their own spin and experience into a piece?Thank you so much for your work! It's very much appreciated!"
16bmon,"This was beautiful football. Not only skill, but speed and strength and a deadly counter as well. Truly awe inspiring to watch. Long live The Invincibles"
3cqhju,"If you enjoy your look and feel good about it then focus on that. Don't pay any mind to your Nmom because nothing good can honestly come from listening to her or even reading her messages. Remember the point that N's are so entirely insecure with themselves that they feel the need to bring others down in order to improve their self-esteem. Do you, boo. Block her and any other people who would prefer to chastise you as opposed to uplift you - especially if it has everything to do with you and NOTHING to do with anyone else."

16i64f,"I really love this, minimalist setups generally lack any character and its rather sad. These pictures are inspiring! Thanks for sharing!"
17yxjd,"Strange, I've actually been working on a children's book inspired by this same picture, only it will probably be a lot different than the rocks movie as mine is from the teddy bear's point of view."
18rrvn,"I'd recommend [Startide Rising]( by David Brin (book 2 of a series, but it doesn't really continue any of the events of book 1, and is a better place to start IMO). Humans are both a client and a patron race. It's an interesting dynamic and a fun universe."
6lut6x,"Check out Mort(e) by Robert Repino. Ants uplift mammals to fight against humans. It's so much more than that though. I really loved it. Also try Seven Wakes by Mur Lafferty. It's about non FTL space travel and cloning, buts it's also a mystery, as the clone crew of the ship have to figure out who killed their previous incarnations when they wake up with no memories. Really absorbing."
17915h,"A lot. When I'm pissed, sad, happy, angry, basically any feeling there is to feel, music is always my go to thing to go along with it. I have songs and artists for every feeling there is. It can draw me out of depression, inspire me, make my day better, etc.there's so many things music can do. It really blows my mind."
16bq23,"You are a beautiful writer and more importantly a beautiful person. Very inspiring, thank you for sharing this."
1814w5,For me it wouldn't even matter. I am the most inspired while in transit. It would be nice to move from place to place constantly. I would really like to go anywhere completely foreign to me and out of my comfort zone. I find that those moments often give me great inspiration as well.
1punpg,Operation Breakthrough and Uplift are two good organizations I work with a couple times. They both showed me sides of the city I hadn't seen before.

People will be thrilled to have you there.Remember, people at the writing club are undergrad and amateurs, just as cautious as you are. Go with the intention to uplift fellow writers and help them, rather than trying to get something for yourself. You can always fix your own writing at home or get feedback anonymously online."
16drmv,The guitarists of Protest the Hero about 4 years ago really inspired me. Took me about 2 years to finally muster up the money to get a guitar. Been playing a little over 2 years now! Although I have been slacking really badly the last couple of months. Can't get over my plateau :(
179yg4,"Booking a flying lesson.I always quite liked flying. Even now I'm well into my thirties, I love being on commercial flights; I'd been on a balloon flight too, which was awe inspiring in its own way. When I first found myself at the pointy end of an aircraft, and realised that I had (more or less) got freedom to point it wherever I damn well pleased, it was just amazing."

1966w6,"I dont think theyre sellouts, theyre still inspiring artists. Ive never been so inspired to change the world since I watched Exit through the giftshop and got the Wall and piecebook.

87j4ps,"Try the Uplift Series by David Brin. Various planets, numerous species. ALL of them are more advanced than Earth."
17uh4h,"First off, it was a good game. I was surprised they came back, and even though I was saddened by the loss, I felt good for Lewis/Reed/other HarbaughI really wanna yell about how much I hated the call against Crabtree towards the end, but frankly if it goes down to one call, then you may not deserve to win. Good game Baltimore.Oh, and Goddamnit Defense. Why did you take half of the game off? [Also, Goodbye Ray. You're speeches were epic and inspiring and you really are the man. I'm gonna miss you]("
17239y,"At first glance, this looks very inspired by Wetrix. That was a fun game."
6dfq77,"David Brin's Uplift series has both. I recommend starting with *Startide Rising*, it has a group of scientists exploring the surface of a planet while a space war breaks out above. Also, dolphins."
16mchc,The pulp era heroes that inspired Batman kill people constantly. The Spider and The Shadow mow bad guys down with twin automatics. Black Beetle does the same. I think Green Hornet may be the first of these types of heroes that goes out of his way to never kill.

16nvfm,"Majora's Mask. It's such a dark, depressing game but the sideline story of the couple in love was such a moment of true pleasure and happiness in the world of pain and suffering. Seeing the couple finally reunite after the three days, exchange their masks and fulfill their promise to each other, and then to optimistically wait for the morning that won't come together is just indescribably touching and uplifting."

192ben,"Very little. We are all on a journey. None of us have reached the destination, and we all get on and off at different places. Usually we view the train of photography from our current location; which changes the way we think about it. When we're feeling inspired: we get back on the train and make our way to a new destination. the only thing that makes me cringe is the photographer that hangs out at the station and critiques everyone getting off the train because he thinks it's his final destination."
16axiz,"Your building inspired me. I found the contest too late to do anything, but I took your design and used it as a basis for my own design and I appreciate a new way to look at building towers now instead of the straight up.

That is unless you weren't inspired by Braid."

1895ip,"Your question isn't vague, it's impossible to answer due to the vast number of artists in the history of the planet. Whoever wrote Beowulf inspired the next generation, etc, until we get to people like HP Lovecraft, Stephen King, Laura Ingalls Wilder. And that's just literature."

15n8ii,"Check out Space Brothers! I stumbled upon it recently and decided to give it a shot since it had great reviews and ratings. After the first episode I was hooked on it.

Everyone always asked me if I wanted to talk and obviously I didn't but she forced me to and it was the most relieving thing ever.Most memorable was when I was sitting on a bench in a rich part of town and this obviously very wealthy man walked by and said ""Just keep your head up high."" It surprised me so much that I'll probably never forget it. I have no idea why he said it, but thank you."

914dcx,"Strayan chiming in:Humans Don't Make Good Pets is excellent, quite funny. Would recommend.Uplift Protocol is good for the first 15 or so chapters, where the plot is being established and the ""working together to run the gauntlet"" theme is still going very strong. The races are quite unique. It begins to fall flat as it becomes more and more a character driven drama. It would have benefited from retaining no more than the original four characters."

17k6j0,"Although I think that this sounds really, really good - but some of the best things about Jagged Alliance is its humor, the hilarious interactions between the different mercs, the strategic map and the generally fun and well-rounded gameplay.

Then again, if they manage to make it moddable and provide a good engine, this could be a great game. I'm certainly looking forward to try it out."
2x4u63,"If some of us were not somewhere on that spectrum, I think our whole species might be losing out. The contributions that people with different brains make can be important.None of us are supposed to be happy and comfortable all the time. That's not what this life is about. A central theme of Christianity is learning to let God uplift us while we struggle with difficult, sometimes terrible things in this world.Your notion that God wants you to fit into the round hole seems flawed. People may want you to do that, but I'm not sure God does."

16olhy,"I haven't read any commentary about the collection, but to me it looks like menswear-inspired through the ages. From pin-stripe suits and sock garters to what looks like modern urban-inspired sagging skirts. Of course, lots of runway fashion is conceptual, and I find this collection inspiring. New takes on old shapes. That's what fashion is, no?"

32d9y8,"I suspect that, perhaps after some unpleasant early experiences trying to uplift neighbours, the Vulcans opted for a hands-off approach so as to avoid getting bogged down in innumerable unpleasantnesses. Earth may actually be a first break, a necessary one, too: A world that just fought a bloody global war but also has warp drive needs to be watched carefully, and guided to a better fate."
178ndv,"1) It's ""Johnny B. Goode"" 2) It's called a stable time loop. He inspired it in 1955, so it existed in 1985, and he learned it then, before he traveled back in time.3) BTTF kinda plays it fast and loose with the logic of time travel. It's best not to overthink it and just enjoy the ride."

Well let's say they were very successful at that..just left us on our own to do as we please, and some of us.. though.. hmm. maybe let's invade a few nearby stars- tie a neutron star into a knot and cause a few supernovas. Wouldn't other alien cultures find that threatening and dangerous? What is their endgame in lifting other cultures from wretchedness?"

1749qz,"One of the most positive things someone has said to me when I was down was a little over a month ago now. One of my best friends if not my best friend had said to me that I was the strongest willed guy he had ever meet and that I inspire him to have a strong will and to be a strong person. It really helped me in knowing that one someone gives a damn, and two it showed me that even if it is small I have done some good in the world."

2xkaal,"A couple of friends of mine would reference poetry in conversation every now and again. I always thought of poetry as being ""lame"" or ""nerdy"" but after hearing it in this light, I felt inspired and moved by how powerful poetry could be and what significant influence it can have over ones life. When you read between the lines and see what the poet may be trying to say or convey it just opens up new ideas and worlds that really uplift the human mind."

Rob Dyrdek you are an inspiration, for me being such a pessimistic person(I need to work on it) you have really inspired me to believe that ANYTHING is possible with hard work and dedication.

If you had a Genie in a bottle and was allowed three wishes what would they be?"

Comparing it to other harder stimulants, it's pretty weak. It's good for creativity and a little bit of motivation, and depending on your dose you will never feel over-stimmed or like a robot.Edit: I really enjoy smoking cigarettes (camel crushes) on 3-fpm and also 4-fa."

8t4xm9,"We’ve all felt that way, when I was much younger that’s all I thought about. I didn’t have support and didn’t have much self esteem. I focused my energies on school to uplift myself, and once I graduated, I resolved to lose weight (which was a big factor in my suicidal thoughts) and travel the world.

To dream that you are being injected for medical reasons indicates that you need to develop yourself on a mental and spiritual level.

16wkh9,"Not awe inspiring but still gets me every time. At the end of the Luck of the Fryrish episode of Futurama when Fry finds out that the man who he thought was his brother was actually his nephew. He spent the whole episode remembering how his brother hated him and thinking that he stole his life he found out his brother actually loves him and missed him so much he named his son after him.This episode hits me really hard, much more so than the Seymour episode."
17wx2d,"Agreed. Major props to you Rocket. I've never seen any developer this active within the communities that he inspired, or a developer as dedicated as you. Amazing job."
167g7k,"A Tuscan inspired city, yet it has teh Pantheon and the Colosseum? Not saying it doesn't look awesome, just pointing that out :P"
165bgh,"My town has a pretty good [photo museum]( A weekly visit keeps my senses awake and my photo lust alive. Photo books inspire me too, I like to collect them, as do good magazines. And when nothing helps, a train ticket to another city, or a plane ticket to another country can be great to revive your interest. The good thing about the latter is that is usually warmer there as well. Good times."
4ooure,"If, for instance, the natives are on the opposite side of the planet environment scale from you, you can uplift them and use them to claim worlds that are marginal for your own people. My desert-loving foxes found and uplifted a race of arctic molluscoids who are now comfortably snuggled under the ice sheets of several worlds my own people found unpleasant."

17l4uv,They won. I saw this thang on current tv back when it was cool that people would dress up in weird funky costumes and go around boostin each other up to the signs to turn em off. Businesses started noticing and turning them off before they could. This just inspired me. I mean ya it took years but those guys finally got what they set out to achieve
17oz9d,"Thanks for this, glad to see some love for one of my favorite movies made from my favorite book written by my favorite person who's work inspired me to become a successful scientist."
18r5ji,"I usually don't give it a second thought. When I do, I feel bad about myself for not trying to run more often, but I also feel inspired. I always think, ""if he can do it..."""
16mq0g,"Hey Arnold! I just gotta say I'm a huge fan of you. Not a lot of people can come over to America, become a body-builder, then movie star, then Governor. All you need is a record deal and your career would be complete!But more seriously, What was your favorite project you've ever worked on?Any words you might wanna share to inspire young film makers such as myself?"
18q1iw,"Any team called ""Trojans."" You may recall that the Trojans lost the war and their city was destroyed. You could name yourselves anything, and you choose these guys to help inspire you to victory?"
166upa,"Honestly, as small a sub as this is, I'd rather it just stay user moderated (with votes). If it helps someone to post their scale victory, then let them!I think we should be much more of an uplifting *community* rather than rule enforcers and nitpickers. Just my 2c."
2xtczy,"My buddies and I regularly do a 4man with 1 random. I find that it actually works quite nicely... because we all react to what the random is doing. And we support and uplift him. If he dives, we all dive with him. If he goes for dragon, we follow him to dragon. We basically become a well oiled entourage for the random.The only problem we have is when the odds are against us and we decide to bail. Usually we all retreat in unison, and the random doesn't realize and dies alone."
1749qz,"""I'm having a baby"" My best friend, his SO was supposed to be infertile, they'd applied for adoption but were both heartbroken about not being able to have their own baby.. Of course, this wasn't him trying to help with my depression, but nothing had been more uplifting than that moment. For anybody reading this thread because they want to help a friend who is depressed, trying to make me feel good about myself, doesn't work. But when my friends include me with things they feel good about, that makes me feel better than any compliment or advice could do."
17j60d,"This is an fantastic post! I am getting very inspired by all these suggestions.Can anyone think of a good Swashbuckling movie? I loved the first Zorro adaptation with Antonio Banderas, but I haven't found a similar movie that I liked since."
18gcp1,"This is pretty inspiring. I've just got the demo right now (Next paycheck will see this game bought for sure), and I just basically pulled my own 'Apollo 11'. Getting to the Mun, orbiting it once, and coming back. Although I ran out of fuel in orbit around Kerbin, so I'm sending up a rescue craft to get our man home!Seriously, this game is just fantastic. Can't wait to try stuff like this when I get the full thing!"
16zk6a,"""Sometimes you don't see the light that is in the world because you are the light."" I was in a bad, bad place and a really kind person said that to me, and it helped me to get through it. I'm grateful for kind people who bother to take a moment to uplift another who is in a darker place."
197ji0,"I've been watching your show since I was 16 and Kitchen Confidential is one of the very, very few books I actually read, enjoyed, and finished. I don't have any questions unfortunately, but I would love to take this opportunity to thank you for the work you've done in life. Your rough around the edges, heart of gold personality really inspired me in my younger years and I feel helped shaped the man I am today. You the man, Tony."
190b23,"I lost quite a bit of weight a year ago, but have gained about 15lbs back. This was really inspiring for me and I just wanted to say thank you and good luck - you're looking great! I just made a 100 day goal for myself and it is great to see what half way through it could look like if I stick to it!"
16msck,You just re-inspired me. I got off my kick and I put on 10-13 pounds in the past month. Thank you. I can do it! 278 to 220 here I go 2013! Let's kick the fat to the curb!
16iecm,"Check out every video on Steve Jordan. Watch his DVD, The Groove is Here. It will inspire you and set you on the correct path. Learn your rudiments first, especially the 'holy grail' - triplets, paradiddles and doubles. Above all, enjoy it. Drums are amazing."
15r1ce,"Not trying. Like, ever. Never tried to succeed in any course. 100% my fault, but also nobody really inspired me."
16hdi5,"Not only are these guys great scientists, but their desire to inspire future generations to *learn* about science is incredibly admirable. We need more of these people in this world."
169s11,"&gt;So I'm sitting there, playing Hannah Montana The Movie: The Game when it suddenly strikes me, ""You know, none of this will actually matter once I'm dead.""&gt;Since that I've taken up drawing and other creative things, since it basically inspired me to do something good instead.I couldn't help but think, ""none of that will actually matter once you're dead, either."""
18dz35,You've just inspired to switch my major and become an archaeologist. Thank you! =)
17bqvq,"Last night's game night inspired me to sign up for Reddit. It was really nice meeting everyone, and I'm really grateful for everyone helping me playtest my card game. I'm looking forward to the next game night."
16zt6v,"I did a lot of things that I wanted to do and focused on actually enjoying those things. I found things to inspire me to make myself better and then did it, like get a new job and start working out. I looked towards the future instead of the past. It took me a while to get used to the changes I was making but eventually I was happy again. You will be too."
1fvj02,"I stop listening to songs about love or songs that have his name in them. I just skip over them. I usually just listen to songs about moving forward in life and that have insightful lyrics that make you think about life itself. I listen to the beatles, led zeppelin, pink floyd, grateful dead. Anything that will uplift my mood."

8g46mv,what everyone else has said here. Those are not real friends if they treat you that way. Real friends support and uplift each other. Feel free to message me as well.
3glru9,"This sub is the easiest to break, just when someone who doesn't win decides to not donate to the winner. C'mon people, it's just a dollar for you, but collectively, it can just uplift the most needy of us all. Pay it forward, even if you haven't received yet. Life always comes a full circle."
162zhf,"I have now been motivated to change my looks.... one year from now i will be back with my before and after photo. The reddit community is truely amazing, i hope you guys know how inspiring this can be for some people. Thank you!"
174fiv,"This reminds me of something else I may do. You see, while this is good, and if done exactly right, could accomplish their goals, I think the odds of that are low. I want to do a kickstarter to ""create"" inspiration by sending out low-cost Cubesat HD cameras to every major (and minor) body in the entire Solar System. Having those feeds is the best way to inspire people, and much, much better than trying to ""argue"" for more money to the world. Anyone up for it??"
162gcm,"In the age of computers and the internet, one hardly needs to OWN works of art to peruse. We have more ability to be inspired by the works of others then ever before."
3k89oa,"Good job my man! Welcome. I believe you'll get a lot out of this journey and the experiences of others ahead of you in this sub. We'll also help you and we'll help uplift you when you get down. We're here to help each other through this, and I'm looking forward to great things ahead for you :)"
16rd0q,"Neuroplasticity in my opinion is one of the most amazing, awe inspiring things about the human brain, and body for that matter."
4bc167,"i don't think so. From what I've heard you uplift species on there native planets because they are adapted to the planet. I could be wrong though, that is just what i have gathered from the content i've seen."

184mer,"Nice! I want to be a guitar teacher, but when i get off work/get off I find myself a lot less inspired to practice. I've just started, but I'm hoping this has a similiar effect on me. I love playing guitar and also need to brush up on skills to feel more confident as a teacher."
5pcdxo,You probably have to colonize the said planet in order to uplift them.
1772oj,"For me it's always the point in which something i do in the game. I love good soundtracks more than any other kind of music. Soundtracks are the only thing on my iPod. If I had to name a specific point, it would be climbing to the top of a mountain in Uncharted 2 and hearing the trumpets hit the climax of the movement as I turn and see the beautiful and awe-inspiring landscape. Everything about that game was perfect."
17zxhn,"I first listened to this song in NYC during the aftermath of Sandy on Soundcheck (WNYC) when my electricity was out for over two weeks. All I had was a radio to break the monotony. The episode had something to do with uplifting music or music that made you happy.I had another Edward Sharpe album but it didn't include this. In 2012, there were a lot of songs that yelled out ""Hey"". This song stood out from the others like The Lumineers."
590mvc,"I'd say its beneficial for the citizen for multiple reasons.* citizen can always look up their credit rating and ideally they could demand an explanation of how their score is being calculated -- this would allow an explanation for their given situation and reduce idiotic ""muh rights"" -movements to null.* credit rating would uplift societies from the old bourgeois / proletariat discourse (unless its pay to win system)* rating system would install a kind of panopticon system and lessen the need for coercive force"
17c0kl,It was a truly amazing match. I have to say I am sad to see DRG lose because he inspired me to play Zerg
1629ky,"congratz on the weight loss, I know its a tough battle.. (that I have lost) you inspire me to get up and try again! and because mine has a short in it.."

198e8o,"The Game + Mystery Method = The starting point of what most people will talk about in terms of just knowing all of the terminology and basics.The Game is also quite inspiring, and Mystery Method is good because you can start using it right away and see if its kind of for you. I read it on an airplane and picked up a girl when I landed."
17ahp7,"It seems like a lot of people around me are having very bad things happen to them lately, so it's really great to see a story like yours - very inspiring - thanks a lot for sharing!"
17fi6l,"Hey David. I just want to thank you for trying to make a better world, it's so easy to lose hope in this world, but people like you help and inspire. That's the chain reaction that will save us in the end, I guess."
186v43,I've been looking on getting a Decepticon logo tattoo... This is inspiring!
17azyx,"Carles Puyol is a very inspiring captain for Barcelona and the very definition of a captain. He can get his players motivated, he wouldn't ask his players to do something he wouldn't do and even if Barca were losing 4 - 0 with 20 minutes left, he would think they could win."
16vjbn,These 2 quotes have inspired me more than all else :)&gt;And the day came when the risk&gt;to remain tight in a bud was more painful&gt;than the risk it took to blossom.&gt;~Anais Nin &gt;It is better to deserve honors and not have them than to have them and not to deserve them.&gt;~Mark Twain
7wfuj1,That pretty much sounds like my one life goal to rule all other life goals Like to just generally uplift people And perform random acts of kindness where can However I'm new to reddit and online chatting for that matter so if you'd like to walk me through how to PM I'd be more than happy to chat
168op6,Woah! Great job! Keep up the amazing work!! keep inspiring others with your weightless! and remember that this is your year claim it for yourself!
7k8kz0,I'm actually a bit thankful when somebody tells me that I look younger than my age because I judge my looks beyond par. They kind of uplift me when they tell that I look like a kid
16qk3k,"Be aware that you will never be able to explain to others the complexities or differences of your life. Make that unimportant. Enjoy that they are living life at the level they know it, be willing to uplift without nagging.Peer pressure has has held back more progress than rules ever did.Don't explain. Enjoy the superiority of your decisions and remind them of the power of Karma in the end!Explain to them you are"
18fz9i,"I had one lady at work tell me that I was inspiring at the end of a conversation about my life. She really poured her soul out about being a single mother and the hardships that follow, and at the end of our conversation I legitimately think she had a better idea of what she needed to do to get her life in a better spot. Someone I had just met. fully letting me know that I helped a mom and 3 kids absolutely cannot be topped in my life."

3e2snm,"Queen Elizabeth country park is good, so is Stoughton downhill. I'd be happy to show you around if you decide to come over this way. Bike park Wales would be a good place to progress, a day on the uplift will do wonders for you."
66tui7,"I'm not sure if a strategy game is what you had in my mind, but have you tried Stellaris? It ticks all those boxes, Space exploration, terraforming, colonization and combat. There's all kinds of other things too. For instance, I managed to uplift a pre-sentient species of bird-things I encountered on one my colony worlds."
60nfg0,"Before Stellaris, uplifting was used for both.If aliens came to Earth, and pushed us along into space, it was an uplift, since they are... raising us to space.Iirc Spore also named it so when you place a monolith and have that race reach space fast.So people still default to the original names even if Stellaris is adamant on it's names."
1869pm,"Brady's performance that night was awe-inspiring and, as a Jags fan, the game was totally heartbreaking. He was like the Terminator of the Gridiron, cold and deadly efficient. In case anyone is interested in a couple key stats, from Wikipedia:&gt;Patriots quarterback Tom Brady set the NFL record for completion percentage in a single game (92.9%) with 26 of 28 completions for 263 yards and 3 touchdowns, while running back Laurence Maroney added 162 total yards (122 on the ground). Overall, New England gained 401 yards and didn't punt the ball until 31 seconds remained in the fourth quarter."
6j7ftv,"Its really funny that when people who put these types of posts. For some reason, they go against it and start being negative. Some people are like, ""there are people who do not care or we have enough posts like these before. Stop getting attention.""We need more posts like these so we can uplift exzap and make him happy. He's human and everybody is different. Hopefully there's more people like you or becoming one. OP"
17oyll,"Live your life to make a difference. Making a difference does not have to be becoming President, solving hunger and ending war.. At least not for me. Making a difference in someone else his life, touch, inspire, love or simply help the people around you in some way. I like to think that I have added something to the world around me, to my friends and especially my SO."
15sdqa,"This has inspired me to keep track of each day, as its own page, in a word doc. Here's hoping I keep it up and can get myself into a better place in life than I am now with this. Thank you!"
18h2qo,"I think one of the reasons that sci-fi/fantasy is so popular, especially post-apocalyptic and disaster novels, is a result of crummy real-life situations. Fighting against impossible odds is a comforting and inspiring concept that can be hashed out near infinitely. Another reason is the high exposure to video games, which obviously lean towards sci-fi and fantasy themes."
16ur2z,"This is the first I've heard this and completely agree. It's super inspiring. It makes me want to be a better all around person. A better citizen, a better son, better at my job. Thank you"
6lp6om,"also you can try to watch this song to uplift you, it helped me alot in rough times. have a great day :)"
15tj9s,"I know the feeling. Definitely keep track of all your ideas, maybe someday you'll get inspired again on a way to flesh it out. That's how it happens for me occasionally. But I've also had interesting experiences where I've just started writing with no end in sight...and let the characters and plot develop as I go. That's kind of the Stephen King school of writing, and it's not always the best and usually needs more editing...but it's a great way to start!"
17s8vj,"Yes, Adventure Time was inspired by D&amp;D BUT! It is highly known that the creators/writers purposely make every bit and detail important to the ongoing plot. I feel like random episodes,like this, do symbolize bigger things like humanity and the purpose of life."
4qgt2o,"Personally I think this is equally true in ranked. Not that I don't think that it's a good idea to uplift and help your team, but I like to do things my way and it pisses me off when people try to tell me what to do."
18cqw8,"I'm going to be the sentimental one and say that apart from technical proficiency and strength, a good climber is someone who climbs safely, and has fun while uplifting those climbing around them! Corny answer!"
1uemgn,"Read. Do puzzles. Write. Do anything that requires brain power. Crosswords, sudoku, trivia, keep up on current events, learn new recipes etc. Do some yoga, go on walks, hell do some sit ups, push ups or go for a jog if you're up for it. It will keep you busy and active, uplift your mood, and help clear your mind."
15wi22,"One Headlight by the Wallflowers is my favorite song, it always inspires me when I'm feeling down. I'm especially inspired by it because Jakob Dylan wrote it at a time when the Wallflowers had really little support in putting their album together."

17m7lu,I have x-posted this to /r/randomactsofkindness so others can be inspired by your generosity!
4bpl6x,"That's called a central uplift formation.You know how when you drop something into water, there is a splash of water in the center that splashes up?It's the same concept; When a meteorite or asteroid of sufficient size impacts a body, the energy of the impact melts the rock at the source of the impact. Then, there is a rebound as the material attempts to return to it's original position. The rock will then rapidly cool, forming a peak in the center of a crater."
18xine,"[At the Mercy of the Emptiness, by Pinocchio-P.]( It was (and still occasionally is) my go-to song for when I felt down, and it inspired me in general for ~2 years."

6vbs7d,"Innovation has been the main force for the uplift of the poor and the continued advancement of mankind. Trying to reduce inequality without abandon will ultimately harm the poor, since the creation of new technology and services will grind to a halt. The average quality of life in 1950 is below the quality of life or poor people in 2017.At the same time, if inequality is too extreme (far more than now), most people won't have access to those new technologies. We need to try to find a balance between innovation and inequality."
17dtg2,"It's amazing how similar evolution's answers to certain problems can be to man-made ones, even when man was not necessarily inspired by nature. It makes me wonder if the technology and/or appearance of an extraterrestrial life form would really be all that alien to us."
185xdl,"I don't have a question, I just want to let you know that you inspire me greatly, and I really look up to you. Keep doing what you're doing!"
160sw4,A wonderfully uplifting story to be sure. All the more remarkable considering how we treat so-called queue-jumpers today. Can you imagine any current Australian politician being so moved by the plight of an Afghanistan family? I guess it pays to be white.
17ye6i,Every single day I'm more and more amazed by your stories. The way you build a whole world of suspense around a new person every day is incredible- anyone who wants to write should be inspired by your style.

18njuu,I am SO inspired by all of your bright eyeshadow posts!
163f46,"Star Wars was a medium-level schlock opera that was elevated to greatness by a truly awe-inspiring musical score. Another earth is like that, but the exact opposite.Great script, fantastic concept, stellar performances ... horrific, un-listenable score. Ruined the movie for me."
16srub,"""One day this all will change, treat people the same, stop with the violence down with the hate, one day we'll all be free, and proud to be, under the same sun, singing songs of freedom like...""One Day, by Matisyahu. Such an uplifting song."

17yzep,"There isn't really a fool proof method. Different things work for different people. I know every time I go see good live music I get inspired. Not just as a musician, but I get inspired in life. I go to the gym more, I study harder and I'm happier. It makes me want to make something of myself.You have to find your thing."
17vd8q,"When I write, I like to put some Ensiferum on. It's quite inspiring."
16xghi,"I personally think the last one is really beautiful. And the rest are very good. People are hating, but not everyone starts out as amazing. Its clear your friend is inspired by Alex Grey, why is it so wrong to practice through drawing like him? There's nothing wrong with that. It's not like he published it and claimed it as his own. Your friend has a lot of potential! I really did enjoy the works a lot, and clearly with your +868 score right now, many people agree. Dont get discouraged and keep practicing!"
16bjhx,"I listen to my favorite kind of music even though its somewhat depressing itself. (Tool, APC, Progressive metal) When I have my fill of that I usually sit at my piano and play for a bit. If I'm too depressed to play, I'll print the sheet music to a new song and just write out the notes. It's mind numbing and distracting. Sometimes I read cookbooks. Eventually I get totally distracted, I learn something and I might actually be inspired to go to the store and get stuff to make something new."
17hmij,"Good job for taking the the time to notice how your senses and thinking have changed. The longer you stay sober the more sensitive your nose will get to other smells like ""wasted potential"", ""desperation time"" and ""unrelenting remorse"". I've found these scents on active alcoholics to be both the most repugnant and the most inspiring."

17ab5h,Take a bath or shower. Turn on music that has a relaxing or uplifting sound.
1954zv,"It's not as serious as yours, but my favourite inspiring quite is this:“Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.”From the amazing mind of Dr. Seuss. It helps me remember that no matter what I feel, or what I am going through, I am me, and no one can take that from me, not can anyone ever replace me. So regardless of how I feel, it's how I should be at the time because I am me, and that's how I am."

191jf8,"Perks of Being a Wallflower. Reminded me of a few things I had forgotten about friendship. Even if you're not in high school currently, you'll find something to be inspired by."
18qegz,"It may seem strange that I think of it as an uplifting book, but Angela's Ashes is. It's written from the author's perspective as he saw his life during childhood. So even though he's living a pretty terrible existence, to him it's just status quo and he lives it without complaint. It really put into perspective any hardships I had. It's also just a brilliant book all around."
16j44r,"What an intense-sad-inspiring story of what it takes to be an elite professional athlete. Also, I'm thankful that I don't have to go through that."
18bhme,"I just wanted to say I love you, and the things you have accomplished with your foundation has been nothing short of inspiring over the last few years. The work your foundation did for malaria awareness is the main reason I'm schedule to fly to Africa with the Peace Corps next year. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart."
15s03o,"A lot of fictional characters I watch inspire me while I'm enjoying the series, but I always forget to adopt their ideologies while I'm moving about in real life. So I can't really say what fictional character swayed me the most...it's too specific maybe if it was which genre or series I can say."

18fn59,"The Indian economy is heavily geared towards expropriating wealth out of the country, I think the first thing a Maoist revolution would achieve in India is double the living standards of the common people and offer new opportunities to laborers, the sick would get better access to health care, and maybe, hopefully, that awful Indian anthem would get replaced with something more uplifting and Red."

15u50j,"I grew up watching TNG too and I always loved Wesley. As a kid it's always inspiring to see another kid be a part of a team with adults, solving problems even the amazing android got stumped on. I never understood the people who didn't like his character, to me the excitement of the show had a lot to do with watching Wesley develop from child prodigy into the mind-over-matter time/space traveller they hinted he would become. Plus he's super cute in those ugly sweaters."

16y8n5,"Do you have any resources that especially resonate with you and reinforce your stoic mindset and appreciation of life? This has probably been asked in various forms many times, but I'll ask it anyway, as I was struck by one recently. I've been re-reading The Ancestor's Tale by Richard Dawkins and remembered how awe-inspiring I find books on evolution, and how powerful they are in helping to *feel* what I can reason, for example the insignificance of my little fleeting impressions and worries. A powerful form of the ""view from above""."
17to11,"I can understand the frustrations people have with it, as much as I enjoy it. I appreciate it for the fact that it was inspired by the works of Jean Giraud and is basically and interactive comic. The exploration is also pretty amazing and the way that you do it really unique. It's a great to just chill with and explore in. Other than that, I'll admit that it's lacking in substance."
7shmto,"As a community we need to acknowledge it. We need lighter people to listen to us instead of getting defensive, we are NOT your enemy. We need make sure the beauty standard isn’t centered around lighter people and that darker women don’t only receive comments about “her skin is so nice”. Yes, it is nice but the skin alone is not why she’s beautiful, be able to look past it like you do with lighter people. Cast more darker women, uplift darker women, avoid color-sensitive insults etc"

It was made by a Japanese developer (Same as the Yakuza series) and it still felt better to me than when I played games like Gears of War when it felt like I was shooting meat-bags. In Binary Domain, so many machine parts fly off when you riddle the enemy with bullets, shooting a heavy gun *actually* feels like shooting a heavy gun. Story was also half decent too, lots of Ghost in the Shell inspired stuff when I played."

18w1hb,"I really like the sentiment behind this song, and it gets back to the engaging music videos like Weezer had in '01 and '94. I also owe at least some of my fandom to this song, as I had heard Make Believe and got into some of that, but really had heard enough to go and hear more. Hearing this inspired me to buy Blue and here I am.I know a lot of people are turned off by the style, but it reminds me of Buddy Holly in a way. It's a good song."

There are few series here and there, though.John Ringo's Troy series was written directly to fill the void of the kind of fiction you're talking about. There are some outlandish parts, but they feel very much like Heinlein or Asimov in their execution.Check out David Brin's Uplift books. There's a bunch of them, and they deal with humanity trying to make its way in a very rigid and stratified intergalactic society."

4wslko,"Not an exact fit, but you might find the Uplift series by David Brin interesting.

Before him, there were very few lead guitarists, as it was a rhythm instrument, but he had to play melodies on it out of neccesity due to his fingers, and did it for every song. There was also another jazz guitarist at the time who pioneered lead guitar. I think it was Charlie Christian but I could be wrong. I have a feeling he was inspired by Django though."
8s8zpu,"People like something or someone and thus they have to uplift it even if they have to ignore its more negative aspects. You'll hardly see people that point out the hard negatives of something they like because they think admitting it will invalidate them. This is a clash between emotions and rational thoughts. ''I like this thing, therefore it's perfect, because if it's wrong, them I'm wrong. And I'm not wrong.''. It's something like that, though maybe not with those exact words.

1701uj,Well I have many reasons to play video games the first and foremost reason is that it is fun. Other then that I am a student that studies programming (system development) and I am interested in how the games are made.

The majority of the book takes place on the ocean, but the intro to each chapter explores the vast (and brutal) ecosystem that exists beneath the surface.At least one of the books in the [Uplift Saga]( by David Brin has a lot of the story on an ocean dominated planet. The rest is very space based though."
573cyt,"David Brin's ""uplift cycle"" books end with a trilogy in which this is more or less the case: there's a big galactic civilization and certain regions are left alone by common agreement (which is sometimes violated by poachers) for a few million years to allow the habitable planets to form more complex and varied life, and possibly pre-sentient life, without interference from already-sentient species."

Rather than focus on aspects such as early literacy, fine motor development, and other things the kids learn organically in our environment, we reflect on the children's essential skills (focus &amp; self control, perspective taking, critical thinking, taking on challenges, etc), and present it with examples of the children's progress through their group work projects and whatnot.

Can you share a little about that process of how the musical story informs or is informed by other mediums and then overflows into them?"

IDK what kind of uplifting you're expecting to get from hearing from people who are going through the same thing you are."
66d620,Openreach are hiring over a thousand trainee engineers over the next year. You just need a driving license. Pay is £20k for the first year plus London uplift where applicable and goes up to £23k plus OTE after that. You'll get certification and options to train further formally.BT group itself in a varying line of roles have a great apprenticeship program.Might be worth a look.
15xk2m,Ice King is sooo eerie... Love all of these! You just inspired me to get my watercolours out and make some art!
6ig9w9,"The air becomes less dense, so less molecules exist in a given volume. That causes less uplift to be created, so the plane has a harder time getting off-ground."
17l0tx,"I am a great fan of your webcomic and especially your work on Child's play and PAX. It is inspiring to see your geeky influence used for the greater good. My only question is - as someone who is looking to start up a local gaming/comic convention, any suggestions, tips or helpful info you would be willing to share? Thanks for being so active and awesome!"
7oiiur,"The first thing that came to mind wasn't the Uplift Series or even A Miracle of Rare Design - where a human literally becomes an alien to solve problems.No, the first that came to mind is Asimov's 'I, Robot.'Robots are *not* humans, and act an operate on a stranger level than us. Just because we made them doesn't make them not different from us."
28b2zr,"The Uplift series by David Brin is full of big mystery, plot twists, big picture universe, lots and lots of aliens, action, and great characters. There are 6 books total. The first book is a little slow and quite a bit different from the rest of the series, but slog through it as it sets the stage and does have an excellent mystery (and opens up more mysteries for the other books). I'm almost done with the last book."
17qo3t,"My high school Calculus/physics teacher continues to help me even through college. He updates me on random physics/science books he loves, calls me at 11 because I posted on facebook about failing my Calc 2 exam to convince me that my life isn't over, and really supports me in everything I'm doing with my career-searching. He's really inspiring me to want to be a physics teacher. After writing all that out, I think I need to send him a thank you letter."
15z9qe,"Most definitely Ireland. Not only is it the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life, but some of the best food I've ever had in my life was there. The housing in the small villages around are absolutely astonishing. The most lighthearted, uplifting music, and the old fashioned cities easily made it the most amazing place I've been to. I even had the opportunity to stay close to the Shehy Mountains."
15xi20,"you've inspired me to try to paint something today!disclaimer: i haven't even got the artistic skill to do the hair in this comic, but i'm not going to let this stop me"

1xfp8l,"There are 3 large settlements in Gauteng inhabited by underprivileged white people, mostly Afrikaners - and many more across the country. [Solidariteit]( [Afriforum]( and [Helpende Hand]( works closely with these people to alleviate Afrikaner poverty, you should contact them. This was also one of the reasons that [Orania]( was created, to help uplift Afrikaners in poverty that can't compete with Zimbabweans that work for way below the minimum wage, and in the process to help Afrikaner culture endure."
176zcq,This inspired me to do a wallpaper.. Hope someone gets value out of it.

15z86k,"I feel like doing a painting inspired by this, all credit for the brain child goes to anon."
25dkyd,"To be fair, aside from Nuclear/Hydro/Wind/Geothermal, all of those other sources were derived from solar power.Oil, coal, natural gas, all come from plant life, sea life, etc. which all depended on solar energy to grow. This was then created from years of pressure from geological sediments and tectonic uplift. The latter of which is driven by the planet's internal heat from naturally decaying nuclear material.So, in essence, the earth uses its internal energy to drive geologic forces to capture sunlight and store it away over millions of years.TL;DR - use nuclear power to capture solar power."
266omu,I'm surprised no one mentioned David Brin's Uplift series of novels yet. Humans working together with enhanced chimps and dolphins to explore the wide but hostile universe; I'd sign up any day!
3dofvz,"Uplift involves modifying a species' genetic structure. There's a very strong bias *against* genetic engineering in the Federation - look at how Julian Bashir's family had to keep his treatment secret, and look at how the genetically engineered Jack, Lauren, Patrick, and Sarina are treated. It's therefore very unlikely that the Federation would use genetic engineering to uplift other species."
1602uq,"I don't think you should wear make up on one eye, as others said, it would draw attention to the right side. I think people will understand your situation, don't worry about it, you look beautiful the way you are, and having gone through this major surgery and going back to work is inspiring in itself, with or without make up."
17hz11,Up From Slavery by Booker T Washington is very inspiring.
69sgct,"Don't just smoke sativa and wait for it to uplift you. Make a plan to go do something, or smoke it before your about to do something that you'd like to be uplifted, and focused for. You're not going to float anywhere, it's not going to MAKE you do anything."

18dogy,Wow. Truly awe inspiring.I only beg to differ about the Flower Power picture. I believe the definitive symbol of Flower Power was [this Pulitizer Prize winning photo]( taken by Bernie Boston. A great man whom I am proud to say I knew personally.

8xwtsc,"Trucks are the dream generally and def for uplift but if you not uplifting there’s a lot of advantages of a good van. I not long bought a Nissan Elgrand (New Zealand), took the seats out. Way cheaper than a trade van and don’t have to worry about security if I need to park up."
18ruht,Good stuff. Reminds me of some Old Man's Child or early Dimmu; progressive and real black metal inspired
1h3som,"David Brins Uplift series is one of my all-time fave BIG stories. It is the tale of Earthclans struggle to find its place in galactic civilization. IMO, nobody writes aliens better than Brin, getting right into their mindset, culture, biology, etc. Taken together, the 5 books are a thrilling, thought-provoking, and optimistic view of Humanitys future.Startide Rising, The Uplift War, Brightness Reef, Infinitys Shore, Heavens Reach, in that order.(Edited to make it readable)"
17vo27,I love a lot of Eugene Delacroix's paintings but one of my favorites is the famous [Liberty Leading the People]( which inspired the Statue of Liberty. :) Cool contest!
17ki1j,"So this got more input than I expected! That's awesome.It seems the consensus is to keep writing which is an inspiring solution. Reading through the comments, a few ideas really stuck with me such as a writing partner. To that effect, I just found a writers group in my town that meets next Tuesday so we'll see how that goes.Since I feel like I can write a short work that I'm satisfied with, I'm going to focus more on having patience with my current writing level when I am writing a move involved piece, instead of getting frustrated."
1767hh,Impressed. Also inspired. I'll be up on time tomorrow for the gym.
3x4rpf,"The Llano uplift is ~an hour drive from Austin, just follow 290 west. In Fredricksburg, follow signs for Enchanted Rock, pretty neat-o granite batholiths. Pedernales Falls state park is good too. Closer to the city, MoPac and 2222 interchange has some large (long and high) roadcuts with very wide shoulders if you like looking at carbonate cycles. Hamilton Pool is a type example of some of the awesome swimming holes formed in the Cretaceous carbonate that Austin sits on, but it doesn't have a ton in the way of outcrops."
82g24o,"My quick answer is (I had a similar thought this morning) I like, even love a lot of songs on those albums. But it’s a struggle to listen beginning to end for whatever reason. They have different vibes. I love uplifter though for the point in my life it came out. I was going through an uplift as it were and it helped haha"
53be9p,don't worry about fitting in just live your life the way you want to and surround yourself with people who support and uplift you. also nothing wrong with a varied friend group. i have friends 15 years older than me and 6 years younger than me. getting older in age doesn't mean you have to alter who you are to fit some societal expectation. sounds cheesy but life is really a journey just relax and enjoy the ride.
180aeu,All that time spent trying to inadvertently kill one of these...your success has truly inspired me.
17pvrz,"Thanks for this post! I think it's great and has inspired me to start my own!A lot of it is missing right now obviously, but I'm just getting it all framed in.Again, thanks for the great idea!"

15s7t5,"I have a million questions for you and the rest of the group, and it would take forever for me to ask all of them, so I'd rather just say this:I just want to thank you and all of the Rhymesayers for all that you guys do. You have inspired me on a level I did not think was possible. You proved to me that hip hop could be more than just meaningless lyrics about money, cars, and women. I hope to one day share the stage with any of you legends.edit: and thanks for doing the AMA, obviously."
3x3n12,"Peace Ma Badu. Thanks for taking your time to do this. Your voice works better to calm my nerves and uplift my spirit than any pill.

18r7pl,Success is never to early to share.It's inspiring to hear other things than all our problems!Share your next A when it comes. What ever day it is.

16fxq8,They have probably spent more time clipping their toenails together than my parents spent being married. That's amazing and very inspiring!
1ln9k0,"I have some personality issue where I want to make other people happy (with me) and will do whatever I have to; I'm also prone to wanting to be around people who are especially unhappy.I do things like bake, run errands/favors, uplift them by fun, engaging things, and by *listening* to them. It takes considerable strain and focus on making it all come off as smooth and natural, but sometimes I get it done."
6lx70l,"This might not fit your bill but check out Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky. On a planet which was meant for chimps to uplift and eventually reach out to contact their human forebears, something goes wrong and the spiders end up getting uplifted. I mention this because there are some elements of hive mind within the spider community, and sections of the book are told from POV of different generations of more and more intelligent spiders."
5wa900,David Brin's Uplift series is excellent - start with Sundiver
15rt5n,"Went to Guatemala on a Medical Mission, pretty much completed pharmacy school (only 13 weeks left!), canceled a big stressful wedding, still married my best friend in a courthouse and had a party to celebrate, went on a honeymoon to South Africa, and then found out I was pregnant with our honeymoon baby which has just inspired a bunch of other positive changes. Life is real good. Thanks, 2012. :)"
6eefae,"It's really simple. Oil and coal are already set up to be harvested and used for cheap. Trump is playing a 40 year plan. You utilize these already established resources to pump the economy up to the point where people can afford solar and wind and efficent toilets/cars/appliances. You need to uplift people, not regulate/tax them into submission. In the next 40 years solar will be the cheapest, best form of energy. There are no moving parts, minimal maintenance, and easy installation (vs drilling/mining)."

16cijd,"I told my buddy that I wanted to study abroad my senior year through the Rotary program. He told me, ""You're not actually going to do that."" His lack of faith in me is what inspired me to actually work hard and submit the application. It was the best thing he could have told me. I have since lived in Germany, studied in Vienna, and had a teaching Fulbright in Linz. I just turned 25 and I have the feeling life is really only just beginning."
4jjiox,"David Brin, the ""Uplift Universe"" novels. Everything you're asking for. Charles Sheffield, the ""Heritage Universe"" novels. SameCharles Gannon, the series that starts with ""Fire with Fire"". Really good throwback political action space opera. All three of the books that have been published have been nominated for the Nebula Award. The first book is available as a free ebook download from the Baen free library. Larry Niven, the ""Known Space Universe"", also *The Mote in God's Eye* and its sequel. Good stuff."

17x6wc,"Don't ""Come out"" as an atheist. Live it as if it is your own decision then eventually do some cool things while inspiring people to live by example. Any -ism can be a positive thing provided that one is able to find their own way.A book is a path,but faith is found in other human beings.Don't flaunt your beliefs on facebook, but rather keep them private and then personally telling your friends your beliefs."
17y85v,"There's something about his approach that we can all learn from. He approached this very divisive topic from a well-informed stance and remained calm throughout. This beats the crap out of most of us who get so mad at the religious folk that we fall into the rant trap, which leads to entrenchment and closed minds. I am impressed and inspired by OPs approach. Bravo!"
18arya,"Amazing progress! May I ask how did you make that chart at the end? I kinda want one. Another question, now that you have reached your goals, has your diet changed into maintenance? what adjustments have you made now that you don't need to lose anymore weight?Congrats again, it's simply inspiring."

1747hs,"Having met the founder of this organization, I will say that they have the inspiration. I just hope they have the international moral support and any-national monetary support to get this accomplished. A promotional video, as heart-stopping and inspiring as this is (I cried when I saw the orbital colonies), is just a video... And thus far I have learned to temper my expectations because the world does not seem to care enough yet, although my own ambitions for space are boundless."
15yzcd,This picture inspired me to start looking for Mighty Ducks apparel. Thank you.
16mq0g,"I'm reading your book! I read a bit more of it before I go to sleep, so the last thing I think about in the day is you buffing your gun show. Hows that make you feel Guv? In all seriousness though, its a great inspiring story so far."

16h11k,"Most manga-ka work under others for years before they get a shot. A lot of it is hard work and effort effort effort.

Read Bakuman, this gives a good perspective too."

2hyly7,"I play a lot of **Race for the Galaxy**, and while some might say it's ""just a card game"" and its exploration factor is really just a card draw, it is by far my favorite 4x game. Of course, I'm also a fan of The Uplift Novels, so I really feel like I'm charting a piece of the universe exploring derelict alien technologies and piecing together an economy. I know not everyone feels that way."

7l2845,"Sometimes I dream of overhaul on the game engine to uplift Forgelight out from the pit of DX9.

18pe8z,"While it is just a glorified spreadsheet, the number of hours it would take me to implement it myself in Excel are worth more than $60 of my time. The approach to budgeting that it takes is the first one that has actually worked for me, and it's inspired me to save far more than $60 since I started using it. They offer a 34 days free trial.

Frank Zappa also said that he considers anyone with this ability a composer."

16jr5c,"The ""nones"" may not be atheists or agnostics, but the fact that they don't affiliate themselves with a church or a religion is inspiring. I believe it's for the same reason they aren't joining the Elks, Freemasons, or Scouts: the younger generations are less likely to be followers, period. They want to think for themselves, and make decisions based on their own knowledge and experiences. I think that's a good thing. The USA has a long way to go, though: ""The average American is slightly more religious than the average Iranian"""

16xxo7,"I'd like to clarify that this is only a piece of typographic artwork, that was inspired by a quote which may or may not have been said by Ben Rich. I am not claiming that i have a source or proof, again this is only a piece of art. That being said, please treat it as such."
192z6f,"Fantastic. You and that adorable little guy are going to enjoy amazing times together, thanks to your new-found health and vitality. So happy for you. Thanks for sharing your very inspiring story."
16cq17,Any skate video really...Just inspired me to hop on the board. Video days definatly put me in my place though
17frxj,"When I didn't get in to my dream program in university, he came over and brought uplifting movies and snacks. We cuddled on the couch with a blanket. He helped me feel so much better"
1693l4,"The lyrics to Let Down are extremely depressing, but the music is so uplifting that I can't help but be a little optimistic, and happy that something so beautiful exists."
16xr9w,This man inspired so many people to be doctors. That's something most will probably never be able to do....This is why we love Trek.

4aewgz,"Settle fast and aggressively, uplift aquatic animals and resistant to extreme temperatures animals, send them to colonize all the planets that weren't habitable by my original species, extract ALL the resources at maximum efficiency, and then - THE GALAXY SHALL WELCOME ITS SUDDEN MACHINE OVERLORDS."
15r27f,I think it's somewhat inspiring as well as referring subtly to *all* creative branches and types of work.
18tmru,"Wow! You have inspired me! This looks awesome! I have a small out dated kitchen and cannot afford to have it re modeled. I know I can now paint the cabinets, change the hardware ( thanks for posting!), and tile the back splash, but the only thing I am STILL having doubts about are the counter tops."

3n04y9,"The Uplift series is a great set of books. Brin really manages to portray aliens as, well alien."
1ezysm,"David Brin's Uplift saga is great for this. The galaxy is full of species all ""uplifted"" to sentience by another. They serve as client species for a time before moving on to uplift their own species. Humans occupy a small, weak place in all this, made more perilous in that they do not appear to have been uplifted by another species while they in turn have uplifted chimps and dolphins."
17i70x,"Just read an article and was inspired (scared) by the idea of our antibiotic drug development falling terribly short of the development of bacterial strains. As a young adult, this was the easiest way I found to at least try to force the conversation."
17l5t1,"No offense, but your subject line doesn't inspire editorial confidence. ""Looking for someone to edit?"" could be read as either ""Would you like to edit someone's work?"" or ""Would you like someone to edit your work?"" -- with the primary interpretation being, for me at least, the former.Editors remove ambiguity, unless ambiguity is desired! :)"
17018g,These Water Color Pencils because I have been so inspired to make art lately and my kids crayola colored pencils just aren't doing it for me.
18anir,"Monologues. We used to just have three people do monologues inspired by the suggestion, then jump right into scenes. It's easy and it lends really well to premise-based improv."
15xh6g,"I know how you feel. It's exactly how I felt in college and high school. To be honest, I suggest using this time as an opportunity to get life experience and to read like a fiend. Go out and try new things then go home and read new writers. Along the way, track what you love about the books you read, especially what stories inspire you to write. (Also write what you're inspired to get on paper.) Eventually you'll find your voice and what stories are distinctly yours."
47q0b3,"I know what you mean. Mostly, I think I'm projecting that onto wishing I could tell myself that years ago. On the other hand, it's hard. And you knew it would be hard going into it, but it was harder than most of us expected. So it's not very inspiring to tell someone - 'you can do it, but it's going to be really, really hard. Harder than you can imagine'. Most people know that already. But I do know what you mean... now that you've done it, you wish you could uplift everyone."
16j6eo,"Prayers need not be eloquent to be sincere and helpful to your spiritual life!Everyone starts from square one. Just start out expressing whatever is in your heart. Get comfortable being honest with that, and the rest falls into place. There are ''official'' prayers of the Church (which can be easily found via google). These are useful if you want folks to know exactly what you are praying, especially if you mean for others to pray *with* you in unison. They can also inspire your own personal prayers."
5gjpok,"You can't really choose to just give up privilege no more than marginalized people can choose to gain it.Instead, it's probably more appropriate to say that you can first be aware of the privilege you do have and second to use that knowledge and awareness as well as that privilege to both combat the systems that give you it and uplift the voices and work of those who don't. Feminism is about the dismantling of these systems and structures so I'd say no, you can't be a feminist unless you're doing these things."
7ncpgu,"My God.... This would be my worst nightmare. I’m so sorry that you have to go through this, sorry your Mom died SO young, sorry she won’t get to see the rest of what her children accomplish. I hope you have the strength she would want you to have, and that you can help uplift your family in this difficult time. I can’t imagine it will ever not be sad, but hopefully, in time it will become an easier burden to carry. I’m gonna smoke in her honor right now."
15tich,"You inspired me to do this, almost. Instead of writing the good things, I wrote everything.I think I've started writing a diary! Well, writing only gets easier with practice."

2nx16c,"The Mote in God's Eye, and the Commonwelath Saga both have as central componenets meeting different alien species, and exploring how they evolved. Dragon's Egg spends at least half the book taking a species from primordial ooze to advanced starfarers. Many books in the Uplift saga deal with home-grown intelligences."

15ue07,"I hate to be a downer, but that's too many things all at once. I far that unless you focus, you'll relapse on all three. That's going to be a lot of pressure on you. I don't want to say that you can't do it. I'n fact, keep me updated. If you are able to, that's inspiring as all hell."

878udx,Really enjoy coming to a subreddit that isn't antagonistic and serves a place to uplift us a people as we work to mobilizing as a unit. Every time I come here I always leave with a sense of empowerment. Good to see a collective working towards breaking the boxes and changing the rules.
7mzz21,"There’s was to change. Maybe it seems wild and impossible (I know it usually just pisses me off when I don’t feel well and people try to uplift me), but there’s ways of ending one life and beginning another. Stop what you’re doing here and maybe do something like join some kind of mission work somewhere. Stuff needs done, the stuff needs people in order to get done. If there’s that much misery in your life, maybe it’s time to do a different one. Ending it prevents this from getting better ever, and it can’t be undone."
17r8oj,"If you're really stuck for ideas, a good way to learn stuff and be inspired is literally to copy something which was originally developed in another language.For instance, you could develop a basic word processor in JS with formatting options.Or you could try game dev by porting an old game to JavaScript using canvas. :)"

7ijkxd,"I’d recommend Vernor Vinge’s A Fire upon the Deep series and David Brin’s Uplift series. I haven’t listened to them as audiobooks, but they’re both unputdownable reads. Check for other Hugo Award winners and you may find others you’d enjoy."
17vsis,"HUGE Fan Lorin, you are truly my favorite artist of all genres. Your music is equally inspiring as it is calming and invigorating. My question is at what point in your career did you decide that you wanted to devote your life to your music? Was there ever any doubts in your mind? What was your biggest challenge or obstacle that you had to overcome (or are still overcoming)?Thanks! Loved you in Chicago on halloween, can't want to see you live again!"
187l35,"Not only is your work awe inspiring and haunting but it's also some of the most ""different"" and original stuff I've ever seen. I love how I can see your inspiration in a lot of the paintings, the time and effort thrown in and how I seem to share a lot of your youth, being in a similar age group. It has a nauseating nostalgic feel to it, scrolling through that portfolio, but in a way that I've never quite felt before. It felt like reliving my childhood in one warped LSD flashback."
36bsdu,"It's not how many hits it takes me to get high, it's the amount and the temp. I could hit .12 grams 2 times or I could hit it 6 but if I hit it 2 times at 400 i'm going to feel it more than 6 at 330F. At least for that ""strong"" high effect. 6 hits at 330F will still uplift you a bit."
24aerd,"For some reason I can't stop listening to [Lost Horizon - A Flame To The Ground Beneath] ( since I recently finally got a hold of that album.Furthermore, [Haken - The Mountain]( has received some of my attention, probably one of my favorite prog metal bands.Finally, I've been listening to some RHCP lately, specifically [I'm with you]( [Stadium Arcadium]( and [The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]( there is something about them that always draws me back to them, really weird but they are my favorite band besides SA and Stratovarius."
3qpoia,"&gt;However, this begs the question: Why do you watch the show, and what do you get from it? Is it a source for entertainment? Does it uplift your spirits when you watch it? Both?[](/hmmm)I would go with both, as well as the great community, references to mythology, it being ridiculously cute, great characters, etc.Mostly though, it's because it's an incredibly fun show to watch."

16cqv1,"In the dance business we have the saying "" There will always be people better than you, and people worse than you. "" That's what I teach the students. So they will always have something to aspire to, and someone to inspire.I love to knit, but I am not so great at it. It is kind of depressing when I see the wonderful things others make.

You are a great wonder to the bodybuilding community and I truly wish you health and happiness for the future."
8457xh,"Ohhh dude INFJ truly leaves a wound in our robot hearts man. I feel sympathy for you, but cutting off all contact is crucial to moving on. Time heals too but overall just go out and enjoy life, meditate, go drink, play video games and do what you love dude. No one in this world will ever feel sorry about you so uplift yourself and do something that you enjoy rather than be depressed over a girl that didn’t see a future with you. Get out of the slump dude it’s all in your head."
18fzgw,"What a journey! You mention you have a ways to go, but where you've gone/what you've left behind in your journey is fantastic. You're inspiring! The best part is that your bloodwork is normal. Also, apparently along the way you've dipped into the fountain of youth!"

Could you try online websites where you meet new people in your area and go do things with them? Just try to meet new people in general, having friends will uplift you so much to be honest."
1893mz,"I like it. It's cool that you're able to use the ion engine for that, I haven't been able to successfully incorporate that into my rover. Am working on a similar project attempting to use the ""rocket skycrane"" method inspired by the Curiosity Rover: Early tests have been, rough, but it worked really well with the probe I sent earlier this year: The key to that is perfect 50/50 weight ratio for balanced powered flight for the final delivery."
1qoym0,"This sounds like a good opportunity to rally support for the Penguin Uplift Project. If we can bring about a race of intelligent penguinoids, then they can form a government in Antarctica, which can release silver bullion coins. This probably won't happen within 2013, so I'm afraid it won't help your gift project (at least this year)."

180vd6,"I usually work on related things when I'm not feeling creative...organizing, building racks and templates, watching tutorials about techniques im not familiar with, sound design and just olaying around. eventually during that period of getting the essential but not necessarily creative stuff out of the way I'll get inspired by something. Also, listening to music i dont normally hear can be inspiring.. try creating projects for yourself with a goal of not necessarily completing a track but accomplishing some other goal and often you'll end up with an idea."

74x6n7,"You can try David Brin's Uplift series of books. It revolves around the idea of humans joining a vast intergllactic society. In this society, every alien race except humans has, at some point in their history, been artificially uplifted (Evolved) by a more advanced alien race."

18g31v,"This is inspiring. I've acquired the rulebook, and plan on running at least a one-off of this game.The character creation is really quite easy, actually. Looking forward to seeing what my players can come up with.There are a few rules adaptations I'm going to make (like translating ""knife fighting"" to ""all melee weapons""), but other than that this game actually stands up on its own. You just have to be able to pick some of the rules out of the rambling diatribes that seem to frequently appear in the book."
1629ky,"That is incredible! Congratulations! As someone who has always struggled with my weight, that is something incredibly admirable that you have done. I know it was hard but you look amazing!

2jv4q5,"&gt;When you do tell me these things that are supposed uplift me, you're only creating a false image and I can't stand that. Actually, they're telling you what they see in you. There's always 3 stories. In this case, there's their version of you, your version of you, and the truth, which is usually somewhere between the other two versions. They're trying to help you see that you aren't *all* the bad things you see in yourself."
15shxi,I have a hard time believing you're the same person. That's CRAZY! That's so amazing. You're truly inspiring!!!!
18teur,Thanks for the warm welcome everyone. I'm already inspired by this subreddit.
34mcoz,"These are a fun read but not the best science fiction though I think the author David Brin is quite good otherwise. The main problem is that these books are the traditional 'Hero Saga' story that star wars, the matrix, lord o the rings, Harry Potter, dune, the bible etc etc and a thousand other stories are structured upon. The interesting thing that the uplift series did was to replace the central hero figure with the entire human race as a group. Though even this central conciet fell apart a bit as the story had to still focus on individuals."

Watching him catch a pick or recover a fumble and then just take off towards the endzone at breakneck-Brady speed is incredible!

It didn't help me because I became and stopped being suicidal prior to seeing it, but I bet it would have done wonders.

46vm99,"Card is a great author. He really is. He's written books about how to write books. Ender's Game is a kind of formative book for any SF fan who grew up in the 80s, for good reason. Card gets a lot of criticism because of his personal political views. Personally, I'd read his works and leave the politics aside.If you like Card (and haven't heard of them), I'd recommend David Brin's Uplift saga, Peter Hamilton's Pandora's Star, and S. A. Corey's Expanse novels next."

The idea that a country can take land by force and/or ""uplift"" the people they displaced to Western-style civilization was still widely accepted and practiced."

18l4rl,Wow! This is so very inspiring and motivates me to work hard! I'm in the process of transforming myself right now and this definitely helps :)
16jtpa,[Language by Porter Robinson](Can't listen to it with feeling a surprising amount of emotion for an EDM track. It's really inspiring.
4st9cd,"[The Recollection]( by Gareth Powell does that. One set of characters get lost in a series of portals and there are several alien races, one of which is... very alien. David Brin's Uplift Saga involves a lot of spaceship based exploration, but also has a *lot* of well thought out aliens. That includes the best alien species that I have ever read, the [Traeki/Jophur]( Part of one book is told from a Traeki point of view and it is very alien, but also very engaging."
8hbd29,"[David Brin]( does this well in the [Uplift]( series. Every alien species has some sort of difference or edge, and most are presented with respect to each other. While humanity is sort of the spoiler in that universe (since we don't fit the mold that literally EVERYBODY ELSE does), it feels very strongly like every species knows how to make its own combination of smart, tough, fast, whatever, work for it very well."
192wau,You look really great! I'm very inspired by you and hope to see less of you in the future. ;)
18s0qc,My username is based on one of the characters who's chapter I loved. Amazing amazing book. Creativity is off the charts. Very heavily inspired by Murakami who I also adore.
15yu7b,Bryan Iguchi's story about dropping all his sponsors just for the love of snowboarding is so inspiring.

16duj6,"Nothing to ask, just to thank you, you are my director's favourite modern composer and as a result I have played most of your pieces. Your music is beautiful. I had the privilege of first trumpet on October last year and it was amazing. Your work is stunningly beautiful. I cannot thank you enough, you've inspired so many great musicians I know into following music."

18l6rw,"Never! See: [Helen Mirren]( And [Kelly Osbourne]( And though this isn't dyed hair, [Lou Eyrich]( is pretty inspiring."
1844ik,"For me, its not about always feeling creative or inspired, it's just putting in the hard, tedious, boring day to day work. It's not always magical, you have to treat it like its your job. You will have lots of those magical moments but it starts with just forcing yourself to sit down and work first. The people that work the hardest reap the most benefits, that should be your motivation."
1727zq,"Possibly inspired by Bolt’s record breaking and myth busting performances, new studies have been done to reinvestigate how far human running potential really goes. The result of these studies according to the Journal of Applied Physiology is that now, top human speed extends to around 35 to 40 miles per hour![Source]("
7b2kor,"It breaks my heart that people die because they can't borrow the money they need, kind of feels like letting someone die of thirst because they can't afford water.Right now loss is fresh in my mind, I don't know how I'll ever be as determined to succeed now that the people I care about most are gone. My working theory is... To honor and uplift their memory and spirit by living the best life I can, even though life feels meaningless without the people I want to dhare it with."
16wzr8,"When my parent's divorced my dad offered to let me move to Louisiana with him or to stay with my mom in Florida. I think if I had stayed I would have stayed the same and been lonely for the rest of my life. Moving finally inspired me to be social and actually try to make friends while also completely changing my opinions on people and how every person thinks, feels, and responds differently to certain things."

5yr5a9,"If I had a decent sleep I feel like I'm reset, clear-headed, motivated in the mornings. Then everything I experience over the day feels like being piled onto and gradually wears me down. Especially mid-afternoon I get very fatigued and stressed. Getting home in the late afternoon I feel exhausted and overloaded. I need to stay in my room to rest in the dark and do low key activity like play music. Then later at night I get a big uplift in mood (usually) and feel refreshed."
18pik4,"Cmdr Hadfield, I follow you on twitter and I am so grateful that you're providing this amazing service of sharing life from orbit with us. You do an amazing job, and I think it's so great that you're inspiring kids and adults alike with dreams of space exploration in such a HUGE way!"

5pk6ls,"Some say that a film with a ""universal"" subject matter and detached from contemporaneous context ages betterBut I think there's also a treasure in films that uplift their era. For example, *Medium Cool* is drenched in its surroundings and I say it still holds up. *American Beauty* and *Boyhood* are good recent examples too"
1959n0,"Hm...if none were allowed to live, I doubt the people alive today would be alive today, since if those with disorders had children, then those children met people who would have met someone else, and so on and so forth, yada yada.Also, music would never have had some of it's most inspiring people.Not that I really care about the situation posed in the question, but those who have had disabilities and still strived in life have no doubt had an impact."
17fl3k,"Thought I'd just write a quick note to say thank you to everyone! The quality of work on here is truly spectacular. I haven't actually done much drawing since I left school but you've all inspired me to take it up again, I'll try to give somebody on here a drawing soon because you're all just so lovely."
188dq9,"Just cry. Let it all out. I've said it before in another thread, but you should listen to the song Forever Young. It has a good message about how the ones who die young will always be youthful in people's memories. I'm sure that your brother would have been lucky to have a sister who loves him as much as you do, and you've inspired me to be nicer to my younger brother and not take him for granted."
16niuv,I make jewelry out of re-purposed materials and you can usually find me sketching out ideas or taking photos of things that inspire me. Sometimes one hobby leads you to more!
16xwec,"I tend to pull for the Korean teams at international events, but GG were awe-inspiring, all the more so after their horrid first day. They are one of the few Western teams to consistently perform at the highest level, and if I were involved with a Western team I would be looking at their approach to the game and try to emulate it."
182vk0,Fantastic movie. I remember watching this a long way back with my dad. It's an inspiring movie.
18sx73,I read somewhere that deadlines kill creative block and I tend to agree. Make yourself accountable to someone else. Involve them in your process and it may help you to be inspired to finish.
170tk1,"This is a really neat project! The art is great in and of itself, but the meaning behind it is really amazing. I'm thinking of doing something similar with derealization, which is similar, but instead of leaving myself, I have moments where I don't recognize my surroundings at all; I feel like a total stranger for a few moments. I don't quite know how to represent it in artwork, but this has greatly inspired me, so thank you for that!"
16hase,"I know the feeling! Its really nice to not constantly have that holding you back, isn't it? Aha, keep up the good effort then, and do your best to encourage others who are on the suicidal road.

Genuine concern is never forgotten, and always uplifting (:"
6sy8b5,"Romans 12:2 comes to mind. Paraphrasing her ""Do not conform to things of the world,but be changed by renewing yourself."" You don't renew yourself by listening to antiChristian music. Surround yourself with things that encourage and uplift you if possible. My opinion. I'm no expert. I think it is a positive thing that you are questioning your musical choices."
167j1d,"Music really does it for me, hearing that song that you love, and really gets you going is incomparably uplifting"
6luzvo,"One thing that I think some of the pieces of clothing people have agreed are powerful have in common is that they evoke a dominant posture in their silhouette. Neck details uplift the whole neck and face area and shoulder details make the shoulders more prominent as they would look taking an agressive/commanding stance. Slight tapers add balance and generally the details together create a kind of ""superhero pose"" look through their design details and shapes."
7aldyv,"It is also really fun to purge pops, enslave the others ruthlessly, uplift presentients only to turn them into gene-modified livestock, and generally Space-Hitler it up."
189vwy,"The more I read from Hunter S. Thompson, the more I get inspired."
16tt18,Very inspiring to me today - I needed that. GREAT JOB!
18a8ur,"I have a pair of Asolo Shiver GTX that never fail to keep my feet dry and provide good grip and dexterity. They're also unique and I've had lots of good comments about them out on the course. You get a low-profile suede goretex waterproofed climbing-inspired upper with Vibram sole. These are light and less bulky due to the climbing shoe profile but still have a heavy duty sole. They're durable too, so you won't be that guy with duct tape holding your keens or merrils together."
17oz9d,"One of the biggest regrets in my life, is I never got to meet Carl Sagan. But one of the biggest influences in my life was inspired by him. Heroes don't always have to throw a ball or save a life, sometimes they just help us to see the stars."
18r6tt,"Now that HTML backgrounds are fixed, the album artwork on the lockscreens is horrible, so I went back to an old friend: [SnowCover](This tweak presents your album artwork a lot nicer.I used the [My. Vinyl HD]( theme, and the background is inspired by [Chaz]("

3xtaqg,"David Brin's Uplift series where the humans hold their own against many older alien races, because unlike them, the human race matured naturally without being ""uplifted"" by another race, so we've figured everything out on our own without access to a galactic library that tells us what we can and can't do.Also check out:"

6sn1ye,"The **DRAGON** uplifted lizards because he just sorta did, the lizards reminded him of himself, and decided to uplift them, eventually they began treating him like their godfather (not the dictionary term).So as such, he treats them, the Lizardkind, like his children."
16p1t0,"So I have Minecraft at home and I've never even given it 15 minutes. This makes me want to begin playing it. Beautiful. I have seen many screens of environs and worlds that people have made, but this simple starting place just inspired me to start and start small. Maybe its overwhelming, just seeing those big worlds, idk, but this makes perfect sense."
7iy2pw,"I feel for you, I have been in that frame of mind. Time to change your focus, change your story. Help someone else. You are not alone and there are so many others who feel like you do. Take a random hour to try to bring a moment of kindness to others, uplift others (even animals or nature, if people isn't your thing). Your situation may be the same, but the way you feel about it might be different. Good luck, I really hope you feel better. The world can be a discouraging place, you can get through this."

18shna,"Keep on keeping on!Never give up, never surrender!Other inspiring messages!But seriously, that's pretty awesome."
15v8jw,"&gt;This time feels different.It's surprising to me how often we hear that around here. Damn uplifting, too. Keep doing what you're doing, man, and keep looking out for other guy. Love ya."
9741fy,"It's never been discussed here, but I like Roger Ebert's notion of [elevation]( It's hard to define, but it's the uplift you feel when a story reveals something sublime and true about life, human nature, our capacity for goodness, etc.. He gives examples. I think it's an important goal to set, to make a story meaningful and memorable. The best movies touch our hearts."
16kvdx,"I completely understand why, from a game mechanics perspective, it's a huge hit. I just think that it could be so much better if it weren't a nightmare from a software engineering perspective. This is why I don't have any ill feelings toward clones of this game. Then again, this game was inspired from [Infiniminer]("
17449w,"There was a lady in my graduate environmental engineering program who was in her late 30's and had been a fitness instructor previously. She was doing a PhD, and was one of the top students too, if I remember.

189hqi,"Afflatus. It means ""divinely inspired creative impulse"" but it sounds exactly like ""a flatus,"" meaning ""a fart."""
18o0kf,"Thank you! I've been working on myself for quite a while now, but still have not had the success I have wanted. People that are trying to be uplifting and give advice on how to be successful are the reason why I am subscribed to this subreddit, as I know I need help. We need more of this."
18r7pl,This made me tear up and helped inspire me to keep working today. Thank you for sharing your awesomeness.

674lt2,"Everyone else made the sensible economic decision that space travel was unfeasible, while humans made it required by law. Now we either find them and uplift them, or find their remains and memorialize them."

15wosg,"Meddle. The first song is straight up amazing rock. A Pillow of Winds on through Seamus are very ""pretty"" songs, they seem kind of romantic (especially San Tropez) and uplifting, and totally fit with the ocean/beach feel the first half of the album plus its artwork gives me. Echoes is just awesome."
15vwd0,"Last Scenario was great if you bear with the game's slow start. As the story unfolds things get pretty interesting. Has lots of intrigue, mystery and lies. It's very long too, I think I spent at least 60 hours to it. Also it's in JRPG style, made with rpg maker or something like that. It's free too. The creator is a fan of suikoden so you may see that he has been inspired by it in some story elements. He made another game that is very similar to Suikoden, both storywise and gameplaywise this time, which is also very good."
4wawwt,"To say my portrayal of AI is merely inspired by Ian M Banks would be downplaying the influence to the point of lying. Both the word and the concept of ""computronium"", as far as I know, is taken wholesale from Charles Stross. I feel like it's going to become a generic sci-fi term eventually, though, like ansible or 'tractor beam.I portray the concept way differently, but both the idea and the terminology for uplifted animals comes straight from, appropriately enough, the Uplift series."
77lv0y,"Okay I tried a little bit more this morning and this is my take on it. It makes me alert but not jittery, I feel really clear and calm, it's got some euphoria and some pain relief. It feels really well balanced to me not too fast and not too slow. Good mood uplift. Situations this morning at work that would normally make me a little anxious or impatient and cranky are bouncing right off. "
77sjur,There's just few or none moments of that album that open up and uplift a little bit. Look at songs like Wretchedness Inside or Revanchist. They hit hard and then start to get a more positive vibe. Great experience. VF is always trying to be hardo metal Draiman brodude!
17us21,I started doing a journal about 4 days ago. I just found a fountain pen and was inspired so right before I go to bed I write enough to fill a page with just what happened that day and how I felt about the experiences and people. It's amazing how before I couldn't remember what I ate that morning but now I remember little details from conversations and details about people. And anything I don't remember I can just refer back to the journal. I look forward to keep this going.
177ree,"I think any style can look good on anybody as long as you fully commit to it and feel confident in it. If you're inspired by Taylor Swift's style don't be afraid to copy it but at the same time be creative with it and make it your own. Also, your style should be for you and you alone. Good luck :)"
1681az,"This will probably sound stupid to most people. But when I'm having a really hard time keeping the anxiety and bad thoughts away when I need to sleep, I go over the ""Favorite Things"" song from The Sound of Music. As I go over the words I try and picture each scene. This means not only am I focusing on something other than what is bothering me, but also visualizing uplifting-ish things."

197ji0,"Always loved No Reservations, it's inspired me to travel and go off the beaten path to try things that I wouldn't normally do. Thanks for being an inspiration and really entertaining! My question: What is one thing people should try to eat at least once that is seen as disgusting but actually is really good?"
17hslp,"The fear of death can also act as a motivator, inspiring you to do things which you otherwise wouldn't have done.Steve Jobs spoke of this during his Stanford speech - ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."""
8f1c1z,It can get better. My suggestion would be meditation. It helps to stay in the present moment.. but I'd imagine they make it feel hopeless because they are themselves. You gotta help yourself before you can help others or uplift them. When I'm depressed/anxious it's hard for me to be a voice of reason.
2pp7w6,"We all have them at my work, I also got [this one]( for home and it's great. Doesn't replace exercise, but it's definitely good for you. These types cost a bit more but they move from standing to sitting heights which is preferable to a fixed sitting or standing desk in my opinion."
51o9bk,"Don't use it alongside other substances to keep from negative interactions with your monoamine neurotransmitters.That being said, chronic usage should provide an increase in spatial awareness, and a slight uplift in mood."

162vzu,"That smile tells me this kid has not only never burdened his parents with his disability, but has inspired them to fulfill everything for their child that many of us take for granted. I'll give kudos, but who am I?"
16q4zq,"Even though it's a sad story, it made me smile just a little that you could say such lame things about yourself, but also really feel inspired to want to fix things. I laughed a little, but only good naturedly!That girl must have been really nice to want to sit there and ask you all of those questions!"
5ah1iz,It actually amazes me how the Nofap process exposes many guys' friendships and honestly I think it's for the good. We are all here to uplift ourselves so it's important that we surround ourselves with positivity.
16lkqm,Great Leader continues to inspire loyalty and creativity in the DPRK. May his name live on forever.
160xn3,"This is really cool and very inspiring, even though I personally am a fan of active rest days.Not to knock any of these people; they certainly are impressive streaks regardless. I'm just curious as to what (distance, time) they consider a ""run"". Do they have to run at least 3 miles per day for it to count as an active streak? The oldest guys have been running since they were ~16 according to the streak. Personally, I would have thought a coach or someone would recommend a rest day.I'd love to see their average mileage over the years."
188x67,"His favorite line was ""you can never know it all"". It has really stuck with me to this day and I try to always think about how others have something to offer to the conversation. I will never think I know everything in any subject because of that one phrase, and it continues to inspire me to learn."
179s3o,"Hopefully I'll be able to get a picture of one, but in my college, there's a guy that posts little notes on the doors of the bus. They are full of inspiring or sweet messages, and when I see one, they really really make my day"

3x16ez,"Whatever your attention is focused on is the direction your life will take. If you focus on your loneliness and your faults, that's all you'll be able to see. If you focus on things that uplift you and bring you peace of mind, your life will begin to reflect that."
16ydsj,"I have a friend who has an insatiable desire to learn and experience pretty much everything. I can tell that it leads to a lot of frustration about not having the time or resources to do everything that he wants to do, but seeing the joy that he gets along the way is inspiring. He has a lot of regrets, but none of the really bad regrets, if you know what I mean."
1f336f,"I would say the vast majority of people here are good and want to make a positive difference in both their lives and of others. Unfortunately, lately I've been noticing an increase in people who are intent on disturbing the peace because they simply can't get over themselves. Anyways enough of doom and gloom, I wish you the best. And be sure to never give up, even when it seems like when the world is crashing all around you. If it comes to that, just post on here and many will be happy to uplift you. Good luck :D"

1850ye,I love that that it's simply American. Everyone on all sides is American. It doesn't matter what side they fought on they were American before and after the war. To me that makes it much more accessible.I'm also truly fascinated by the rise of generals. I love biographies and the more obscure or lesser known the general the more interesting and awe inspiring the story.

15vnt9,Jesus tapdancing Christ! We [Canada] better regroup during the 1st intermission and come out inspired.
2cqzqb,"The 'Uplift' books by David Brin are quite excellent. Not quite what you are looking for, but his descriptions of alien races, their cultures and worlds are superb."
16j1nb,"* **Courtney Crumrin** by Ted Naifeh is technically a series of minis that have become a running series, but it's a fantastic tale of a young girl and her adventures with magic. It's the first series in a long time that's filled me with that incredible child-like sense of wonder and awe.* **The Escapists** by Brian K. Vaughan is an 6 issue about a young man and his dream of creating comics. It's pretty clearly about how much BKV loves comics, and it's inspired by Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay."
7s90tp,"David Brinn's uplift series would be a CGI extravaganza. A galaxy full of insane species, talking space faring dolphins and monkeys and some really interesting sci-fi concepts about the origins of life.Also his book 'The Postman' would make for a truly engaging series in a post apocalypse world and would go a long way to correcting that Kevin Costner abomination from the 90's."
18vtqa,"My personal choice for getting pumped up is watching the dialogue between Rocky and his son in the 6th part Rocky Balboa. Sylvester as Rocky and his booming voice can actually uplift a lot of broken souls. Try it out, listening at full volume. Let us know the results."

18j843,"I was in a shady Mexican restaurant that doubled as a meat market once. I was looking at the steaks despite not having any money for one. He asked me if I wanted to buy one, and obviously I couldn't. He said in a thick accent, ""That's ok. Some day you'll get a job and work hard and earn enough money to buy yourself a big steak."" Very inspiring."
16tzx7,"It's home. Sometimes it's dysfunctional and there are problems, but it's also big, inspiring and full of interesting people."
16c76i,"Practically anything by [Akira Kurosawa]( has some real Zen inspiration to it. His heroes, rather they were murderous Samurai, or weak charactered folks who somehow save the day have a very deep, almost Shakespearean quality, often, that is inspiring. And then there's [Yoda]( who believe it or not, was inspired by Kurosawa, thanks to Lucas' love of his movies."
18zrb3,"As others have pointed out, atheism is not a system. It is a singular position on a binary issue and does not posit anything comprehensive about the universe. It provides no symbols, no guidelines, no conjectures at all, beyond that the God hypothesis is insufficient to inspire belief. One can be an atheist and a strict rationalist/materialist, or one can be an atheist and still believe in ghosts and fairies. Even though these two hypothetical persons have *completely* different systems of belief, they can both still be correctly called atheists if they do not believe in a deity."
1708hx,"I was riding before it, but the first vid to get me excited to ride was Hoffman's ""Until Monkeys Fly"".It's a bit corny, and I don't think any of the tricks on there are things 12 year olds can't do today, but man Taj Mihelich's flow and Day Smith's flatland part are pretty inspiring."
72o0t7,"""Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"" - Matthew 7:3I love this verse because it humbles me and keeps me conscious of my worldly biases as well as reminds me to uplift others rather than point out their faults."
16zf24,"Well I thought i was very well done. :/ It included a good variety of people and showcased the positive side of the fandom, which is adults actually taking these lessons in friendship and applying them to real life. The show actually transforms some people into BETTER people. It makes friends and connections between people who otherwise wouldn't have as many. Like the one dude who hasn't drawn since his dad died, and then ponies inspired him to do art again.Parts of it gave me the warm tinglies."
162vzu,Such an awesome little guy!!! Very inspiring and puts a smile on my face.
189okl,"Hands down, be an astronaut. I think being one of the elect few to escape this earth would be the greatest honor of my life. I'm currently a scientist and engineer, and would love to conduct experiments in space to study the effects of a zero-gravity environment. Also, I think looking upon the Earth from a distance would probably be the most humbling and awe-inspiring sights a man could have."
17wc3c,Looks like I've got a mess on my hands...... thanks for inspiring it! &gt;:-D
18rs3e,"Dystopian societies like 1984 and Brave New World inspired me to write Legend of the Elementals. The 4th book comes out in about 2 weeks. [The first book is FREE]( it follows 4 teens out of the old world who awaken in a prison canyon of the post-apocalyptic Empire of Devidis, where freedom and supernatural talent are heavily regulated..."
1qzgmg,No doubt our contributions to the planet will someday affect the next superintelligent animal. I only hope we allow the sentient creature a chance to develop its own culture without imposing sapien thought and languange patterns as some have suggested -
17a4hq,"That was brilliant! Thanks for sharing this. Not only was it inspiring and motivational, but really interesting too!"
1893o4,Your story sounds almost identical to mine minus a couple things. I too lived a life of excess and have been paying the price for it. Constantly feeling like I'm dying. like my body is sick. I'm beginning to feel better and I just wanted to let you know your story inspired me. Lets do this. Its hard to have happiness without your health.
19435t,"My favorite quote was ""What could not be changed must be endured."" I find it inspiring and it reappears throughout the series. I like it, but there are so many good quotes."
17thxt,"I dont have a question, i just want to show my support. Even anonymous internet users can and do care when a total stranger steps back from the brink, as anyone can see feom this AMA. Stay strong, man, youll inspire..."
17wwik,"As Law stated Weaklings don't get to chose their way of death. Gol D. Roger went to his death willingly. He was sick and that was the way he chose to end it. He knew the world would be watching, so I think he used it to go out with a bang, and inspire the next generation. His crew didn't need to save him because he was where he wanted to be."
171w1m,"This is probably one of my favorite Carl Sagan quotes. So inspiring, thank you OP."
8dlzeu,"I helped a friend build a computer last year. He got a X370 Aorus board, a 1600X, and 2x8GB of B-Die RAM. He didn't really know anything about building PCs or messing with BIOS so of course his 3200MHz CL14 RAM was running at like 2133 CL15. I helped him turn XMP on and he noticed a big uplift in games, particularly frame drops and stuttering, and the difference in synthetics was anywhere from 8-12% or so.Turn on your XMP, noobs."
182pnk,I just wrote a piece of music inspired by how small I feel when I think about this stuff. thanks for the gif!EDIT: it should fit nicely to this gif.

15zy88,WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT TOLKIEN'S WORK IS INSPIRED BY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MYTHOLOGY. NOT EVER COMMENT NEEDS TO MENTION IT. THIS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
1e613o,Change of any kind is extremely effective.I have found that something as simple as rearranging the furniture can give a surprising uplift to your life.
18ujl4,"These questions are ridiculous as they inspire generalizations and are meant to fish for certain answers. I wish they would stop. Whether a person wants to enjoy single life or settle down is dependent upon that individual, not a gender. The answers will vary as much in women as they do in men."
16srub,"""The dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.""Harburg was a brave writer for his time. To write a line like that during the depression era...literally daring people to dream. It's inspired me my whole life."

5njfcl,"It's only somewhat military sci fi (although what it lacks in military action it makes up for in space dolphin fights), the Uplift Saga was a great series on audiobook."
493ahd,"This is a trick from Satan! He thinks you are unworthy of God's mercy and forgiveness. He wants you to despair. Don't fall for this! God wants you to ask him for forgiveness and mercy. All it takes is lifting your hands and saying two words ""Allahumm-agfirlee."" The only way to uplift your spirit is through atonement."
16bjf2,"Guns N' Roses for the most part inspired me to pick up the guitar. Slash's leads always went perfectly with their songs. I don't really listen to them much anymore as I'm more into stuff like Opeth, Devin Townsend and BTBAM, but I always get a special feeling of nostalgia when I hear their music."
1776eq,"I wish I had something inspiring or insightful to say. I just wanted to throw good internet feelings and virtual snuggles in your direction.This is your pregnancy and your choice to terminate. You and your partner are the only people who have to find peace with it. Try to focus your energy on why you are making the best decision for your family of two and being content, and attempt to let all of the rest just be ""noise"" you filter out. This is about you and your family.Wishing you health and peace."

17pe1r,"I have to say it's a three-way tie between Thorn Elemental, Sacred Nectar, and Raging Goblin.Thorn Elemental was the first fatty that I was ever awed by. Sacred Nectar was the card that made me appreciate Magic flavor and naming conventions (I wanted to taste that nectar). Raging Goblin inspired my first deck, a mono-red Goblin beatdown monstrosity."
177fzp,"Any plans on collaborations or shows with Hammock? I know Marc Byrd and Andrew Thompson both look up to you, and you inspired them a ton with their direction, e.g. ""Maybe They Will Sing For Us Tomorrow"""
188y9g,"This is the conclusion I've gathered: Infinite regressionThey'll thank God for the food, but when rationalized that the food was actually provided by the people, they'll thank God for giving people the will and kindness to go get the food, then when given an argument that it was self inspired, they'll thank God for creating or giving us a world to plant such foods...yada yada yada"

1iodrg,"The ""higher ways"" of divine God are the supreme morals. Eternal God is absolute and his high morals are not less so.Human consciences go through the trials &amp; tribulations of achieving morals ""higher ways"". But we as a collective society must uplift our planetary culture to the exemplar life &amp; teachings of Jesus. The same Christ Jesus who revealed the True Nature of God the Father."

188ybp,"Any reason you choose a Catamaran? I get that they are (usually) faster than single hauled (and single hauled have cabins) but what about a trimarans?I'm so inspired right now, I have been sailing 20ft Catamarans for the last 6 years and have always dreamed of a long distance voyage.

16tvmx,"I've got to say, that the composition of this picture is amazing. The way that the child is so perfectly silhouetted against the animal is beautiful, and could be used to make a painting. I'm imagining this arrangement portrayed is so many ways, I just had to let you know what a good picture this is, and that I felt inspired."
16bkrr,"Back in 2009 I recorded a Dark Tower inspired song for a music project. I can upload it if you're interested.EDIT: okay, [here it is.]( I know I'm not the greatest singer but I enjoyed making it. Lyrics are in the video description."
15y8c3,"Digital modeling technology is awesome, but it's just being used to replicate old designs when there's so much more out there. If I want to get the sound of a vintage tube amp, I'm just going to get the tube amp. Also, from a creative standpoint, I prefer having some limitations. Working with one amp sound and bending it to my will is inspiring."
18r0wt,"The Saturn system is so beautiful. Rings, volcanoes, frozen moons, the backdrop of the yellow gas giant.[The gravity of moonlets pull the wispy rings](I badly want to watch high quality video of all this. It would inspire the average person who never thinks about space."
18bam3,I enjoy hearing stories about people being kind to others. I find these stories equally inspiring.
8zyutb,"How is your general fitness? If your core is not strong, you might be lazily putting weight on your hands.Sore hands are par for the course I'm afraid, even the best of the best will suffer after a long day of uplift. You limit the impact by ensuring your bike is setup correctly, you have good form, light hands, heavy feet, and strong core."

6xeq18,"Dont do what I did and decide to try a black at the end of the day. My shoulder did not thank me for that one. If you can, take your own bike as you'll be more familiar with it.Hotstepper (red) into Terry's Belly (blue) is amazingly fun. Only discovered that trail at the end of my most recent visit, but I could happily ride that all day. Only problem is that it's a bit of a climb back up to the uplift at the end but definitely worth it."
17h76f,"Because believe it or not hitler was very,very intelligent not to mention one of the greatest orators of history I just finished watching this video of some of his speeches and I'll be honest I got a little bit inspired until I remember what he did. Not to mention he was at the highest level in the german government and the acts were slowly progressing through the years."
16zh5l,look at David Levinthal's Hitler Moves East Series. May help inspire the rest of your work
1601r5,"Hi! I admire you leaving your job and school to pursue what you think is the right thing. My question for you is inspired from the movie Fight Club. If you could fight any of your favorite artists, who would it be , and why? As a bonus you will get to have a beer together afterwards on the sidewalk and talk about anything. As a painting, I wonder if you could do something silly. Like a girl living in the dream of a pug."
16zt7t,"I don't think people think about *why* they have an opinion anymore. I've been kicking around the idea of deleting myself from facebook; it was great until ignorami like your gun enthusiast friend here took it over. Indeed, your post has inspired me! I'm off to kill myself from the book, excuse me..."
18yt8s,Your last picture really inspired me: Hope you'll (both) like it!(it's a little raw but wanted to finish it in one session)

Your love for everyone and everything is inspiring not mentioning the absolutely terrific music you make. My only question is can you PLESE play immigriniada at one of he ATL shows this spring. I have seen you 10+ times and yet to hear my favorite song
1sonn8,"The Uplift series of books by David Brin seems to meet your criteria. There is a advanced civilization of alien species, most of which have been ""uplifted"" from pre-sentient species by other older alien species. Humans are an odd exception, as we appear to have evolved on our own. ""Startide Rising"" is basically the starting point to the series."
19tsa8,People underestimate the ability of sports to bring people together and uplift spirits. Hope all goes well for you and the family.
3lyjfb,"You are not your mother. You are aware. You are strong. You are loving. I completely understand the struggle with guilt- that's my nmom's favorite form of abuse. I am trying to surround myself with people who uplift, support, encourage and truly love me. This group has also helped immensely and I've only been on here for a couple of days!"
16njra,"After seeing this post, I made some following the instructions. My first no-knead bread as well. Turned out marvelous.I went to cooking school years ago and loved making bread, but found at home attempts and fussing with water bottles didn't make anything so glorious so easily. I'm adding this to my weekly routine. Thank you for posting this, and inspiring my bread tonight! :D"
6exzfm,"David Brin's [Uplift Series]( has a lot of strong women- I usually start reading the series with Startide Rising. His novel [Earth]( has a number of strong women. Neal Stephenson's [Seveneves]( [A Door Into Ocean]( is very explicity feminist SF, but it has some strong male characters as well."
16i3qa,"Because she likes Luna, look up her jewelry and make something. Anything you would need could almost definitely be found in a craft store pretty cheap. Then you'll be able to give her a Luna inspired gift that you made yourself. Hope this helps!"
15tduu,"As others have mentioned, try reading the Bible - it's what ultimately inspired me to become an atheist.As you read it, use a counter apologetics reading guide like to help understand why those without faith find the Bible and what it promotes so deplorable."
180w37,I hope Sean Penn sees this! He has inspired this talented young man and it would be wonderful for him to see his work up close!
18okhc,"Both but usually creators inspire me to follow characters further. For example, I really like Hickman and was a big fan of his earlyImage books. I read his Fantastic Four run and now I keep reading F4. Same thing with Alan Moore and Swamp Thing. But some characters like Spider-Man and X-Men I just follow and hope a good creator comes along like Grant Morrison or Brian Wood...and Bendis too, I'm quite happy to see him writing some X-books right now."
37eq00,"Heavenly father, I pray that you strengthen and uplift QuoteMaster27. Deliver your knowledge and wisdom upon him. You know the situation Lord and I pray that you manifest your might in this situation! Praying for you! PM me your name if you'd like me to add you to my prayer list! Also, you can say a prayer for me as I am in need of God's miraculous power as well. God bless you!"
15u2ve,"Have you ever tried longer hair? It could really change how your face looks, and make you feel a bit different about it. You're not ugly, but you seem nervous about having your picture taken (And social situations?) and sometimes change can help inspire confidence."
17su4n,That's adorable! What recipe did you use? I saw [another post like this earlier]( I feel inspired to bake.
153itd,I agree with the Phreak. I took a year off after graduating high school to work a dead-end job and it was inspired me more than anything else to work toward higher education. I know I don't want that life and that's enough motivation to keep me going and being grateful for what I have even if it's just a little better than that was. If you've never been independent from your parents and out in the real world- that is probably your problem.
16yax6,"Great job! I'm also 5'8"" but started at 170, hovering around 145 now... You are at my goal weight, so this is super inspiring! Thanks :)"
18r5ji,Whenever I see a chubby runner I'm inspired. I know running is hard enough as an average sized guy and it just impresses me to see someone out there that has a little more to overcome out there doing it.
16x7v5,"NISHANU was heavily inspired by Thomas Koner's Daikan, Permafrost, Kaamos and La Barca records; and also January in the beautiful pacific-northwest.All sounds are created with voltage controlled tone generators processed with voltage controlled Moogerfooger effects; finished with Eventide effect boxes. The recordings are then arranged, layered and mixed using VST plugins and Ableton Live 8 64bit beta.100% of all profits from NISHANU and any other Tenskwatawa production will now be donated to The Nature Conservancy at the end of every month.released 20 January 2013"

164scl,"When I was homeless, it didn't happen that often, but people would sometimes give me a few bucks, water, or food without me asking. They didn't even know me, I was just someone walking past them, and they felt inspired to help me out."
5f50tb,"Walang funding and support kasi. Look at korea. Prior to exporting kpop, they invested heavily in the arts. Same with taiwan. Im short, with support and funding, the government can somehow shape the media consumption of its people, media that can uplift and educate them, rather than dumbing them down."
1665wg,"This is by far my favorite TIL. I just love how they are accommodated and allowed to wear their turbans no matter what, and how they incorporated their occupation into them as well. It's a really awesome lesson of acceptance and tolerance and it is really inspiring to see."
162mrj,You inspired me to post some of my own. Thank you so much! Please share more angels!!
17l12f,he wouldnt steal wedding rings either. and other robbers that were inspired by him would burn the debt books owned by the banks so that the customers could be free of debt during the great depression. Him and the ones that followed had the support of the people.
16ghtv,"Wow, you look a LOT smaller than a size 10! I'm right around where you started out in terms of weight and height, very inspiring to think that I don't have to be at final goal to look fantastic!"

18avzp,"I constantly get The feeling people are negative because they Would mot have The courage to take The leap. I admire you for your dedication. Honestly I already feel inspired! Best of luck / Imalet, EUW."
18ppik,"I'm a guy, but I have really small hands. I find that my J-frame with extended wood grips is very confidence inspiring to shoot. It's light, so it doesn't feel too clunky in my hands, and the extended wood grips give me an entire handful to hold onto when I unholster my weapon. In other words, it doesn't feel like the gun is going to fall out of my hands when I fire it, which I feel is a problem with carry guns for people with smaller hands."
7fe0jd,"I think Kerr's a great coach but I think he's making a mistake if he doesn't play Bell. I don't care if he makes mistakes. High energy, max effort, super talented, playmakers like Bell uplift the entire team. Everyone knows a problem this year has been our focus and energy. The way Bell plays is contagious. He elevates everyone's games."
18kqk3,"She's inspiringIt says on the website that she hasn't made her target, I can't afford much but I'm going to put some her way."
7j83y8,"I won't lie, I'm very, very disappointed. The posts trying to uplift Team Sigurd are well-appreciated, and I'm glad that there are members out there who see the best of the situation, but I'm afraid I'm one of those who don't even feel salt, now- just bleak shock. I truly wish I could have brought Sigurd the victory he deserved. Being defeated by a previous winner of the gauntlet is quite a slap to the face."
4gq3jq,"You kinda have to know the audience you're trying to enlighten. Think of it like this, the PCMR is constantly trying to uplift console gamers, but they've been drinking the koolaid for so long, even reason cannot change them regardless of all the benefits. These people you're offering enlightenment to, they've already chosen their lot in life.Let them stay in the dark."
18rblj,Have you heard any of Steve Reich's Radiohead-inspired pieces that premier next month?
18xnz7,"Very great!!! Don't worry about the skin, you look so much better!! Very inspiring...."
2h1epx,I'd suggest:Stranger in a Strange Land and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress - Robert HeinleinHyperion series - Dan SimmonsUplift Trilogy - David BrinThe Player of Games - Iain M. Banks
5glesw,Ohhh last time I did an all nighter was when I had a little reunion with a couple of friends. They filled me with such a happy mood that I wasn't tired at all. It had been so long since I felt that happy that I couldnt just go to sleep and let the feeling banish. So good job in trying to uplift her spirit!
187vry,"Then they tell you that if you work hard, God will come in and help you out. If you succeed, hurrah, God/Jesus was there and did it for you! You failed? Guess you weren't doing enough to inspire support from the guy upstairs."
162539,"Prayers for you,Sue and your family.I think that you are one of the most generous and kind people I have run across on the internet. You inspire me. My condolences."
17em49,"hey, I do the same thing! I have been cutting out and saving art that I love from Juxtapoz, Giant Robot, and Hi Fructose for years. I have all different sizes of canvas, and lots and lots of mod podge! I like painting around the edges and making a sort of frame for the picture sometimes, or making a collage. they also make awesome gifts! This post totally inspired me, I'm going to get off the internet and do something creative now..."
17xrhl,"Beautiful! For those inspired to make at home ensure you're buying ""sushi/sashimi grade"" salmon!"
161ba7,sounds pretty good man! inspired me to pick up my guitar…any song that you mean or comes from the heart or has an emotional element will touch others. Keep it up.
95p2as,"I'd say this is accurate for the people who play the game. It's not the game's fault. You can change all the mechanics you want, but if you cater to the potatoes you just end up making Battlefield 5. If you want Post Scriptum to be Post Scriptum you must uplift the player base, not talk down to them with mechanics."
17emcj,"Wow. All of my feels.It's people like you who honestly make me just love life. I can't actually think of what to say, but you gave me a smile on my face that felt different than usual. You've inspired me man."
16ztc3,Amazing supplies! I liked the colored walls better- more cheerful/pleasant/inspiring. :)
16e68p,I really like Pet Sounds. I can see how Rubber Soul inspired Brian to write it. I also enjoy Smile because of how hard he pushed the boundaries of what could be done musically at the time. It's a damn shame he waited so long to finish it.
16otr4,"I think a great way to overcome writers block is to avoid the term all together. There is nothing blocking you, you aren't being physically restrained. You are uninspired. The best way to fix this is to get inspired by any means necessary.Do something different, talk to someone you wouldn't normally talk to. Oddly enough I like to look at pictures of people on Facebook. It's weird and creepy haha but damn it it works. Music does it for me as well."
17ivpd,I don't think there has been anything on the web from the last year that has been more inspiring and has appropriately captured the human spirit than this collection. Well done and thank you for instilling me with an honest felling of hope and goodness with these images.
18nxzm,"What I love about these kind of videos is the music. Specifically the 'inspired by' music.I'm looking at you, song that sounds like the main riff from Knights of Cydonia by Muse, but changes a single chord."
13zg1p,"Just finished this book and literally found myself crying the last 15 pages or so. I was so touched by the depth of emotion packed into the pages and even tagged a page or two for a quote I'd like to go back to later and add to my motivational board. While the idea of a narration by a dog may seem odd, the lessons are beyond the imagination. I would love to meet Mr. Stein and understand his mind and how he can sit beside himself to write from the perspective of an animal. Creative, though provoking and inspiring."
177n1m,"Consciousness is an amazing, awe-inspiring, unfathomable miracle.As is physical matter.However, our understanding of neither of them is improved by the addition of theology."
17ivpd,"There is some amazing photography here. Id really like to become a good photographer, this stuff is inspiring"

16lm0n,"At first, I thought you were far too pretty to make an ugly face work. And then I saw the last, inspired, birdlike face. *Bravo*Also, cool name."
4egbnw,"Democracy is never the convenient option, it's an annoying hindrance to the chosen authorities - but as an ideal, there is none better to uplift and represent the society.There needs to be a lot more protests like these, if tens of thousands of people marched and blocked the Capital Building - if tens of thousands marched and protested against banks everyday, change would happen.This type of action is what Sanders is asking for in his revolution."
2dle3t,Angel wasn't planned as the final but ended up being it. Okay so my feelings on this are both are true. Buffy shows you can be good and uplift both yourself and others and that is how your good wins in the end but it doesn't always matter. If you are good you are winning but evil does win the war. People(good and bad) both die and dont always get what they deserve in our world. Don't focus on the whole focus on you and triumphing over your own problems and uplifting yourself. [](/cooldash)
42ycdl,"Dudes, like Kid Rock really uplift me. I look at a dark world full of greed and self interest and I see light, hope."
16mq0g,"Dear Arnold Schwarzenegger,You were always a hero for me in the inspiring process that you always pushed and fought towards your dreams and aspirations, despite what others said.

169hb6,"I know I'm late to the party, but Dr. Seuss has always inspired me with this, ""I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind. Some come from ahead and some come from behind. But I've bought a big bat. I'm all ready you see. Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!"""
16s3es,Thanks all. Yes the blue striped one.got ruined but the rest look awesome. I have to say you all have inspired me to get better. I'm going to school for Esthetics and want to eventually open my own salon. My nails are my life lol.
7hw9b7,"I'm going through this myself. I don't have words to uplift you, and I'm sorry. It's a crippling feeling not feeling like you can dig out from the hole you're in. I hope things get better for both of us."
16hmwu,"Just keep thinking about how great you are going to look after you've exercised and how much healthier you're going to be:) if your a girl then maybe buy an outfit in a smaller size that you want to be able to wear and just keep thinking about that when ever you want to give up:) its hard to say what should motervate you as everyone different. I'm losing weight being I'm going to a concert, maybe plan something for the future that will inspire you:) good luck"
15s7t5,I don't have any questions. Just wanted to say thank you for your music. It really opened my eyes and got me into hip-hop. Also inspired me come out of my shell to write my own stuff.
16t0vf,"Doctor Who, the way they write The Doctor as seeing more in people than they see in themselves is inspiring. It helped me to do so much, and see that everyone has flaws, but that's not what defines them, I look deeper into people and see the good."
170ois,"Apologyman wasn't doing anything too impressive from a technical standpoint, but he tends to make unorthodox, yet intelligent decisions in situations where I personally wouldn't even be able to fathom what hit me at all. That is really the entertaining part of it for me.And yes, this is mostly inspired by the anti foot dive snapback -&gt; xfactor"
5ilyxn,"I second the Mote in God's eye series. I'd also suggest David Brin's [Uplift Series]( ...humans and very smart ""uplifted"" dolphins and chimps travel around a very hostile universe. Lots of threats and battles."
162idf,"* The first three Silent Hill games are great and were inspired a little by David Lynch; the fourth is great but the atmosphere is influenced by Japanese horror more than Lynch. * Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem is a really cool game inspired by Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft; the sanity meter is really cool and I recommend not reading about it before the game. * The scariest and most suspenseful game I've played is Fatal Frame II, a survival horror game where you must take photos of ghosts to survive."
18u2x6,"This quote from the new Q*Bert champ pretty much sums it up. “Whether you are climbing a mountain or swimming the English Channel, it’s about pushing the limits of human potential.""Inspired? Yup."
3fsg0f,"Looks like an outcrop of weathered granite (or some other kind of igneous intrusion). You'd call that a batholith or laccolith, depending on how the magma was emplaced. Mount Rushmore is carved into this type of material but there are many examples all over the world. Basically what happens is a large body of magma is injected into into the county rock (usually during a mountain building event), but never makes it to the surface to erupt as a volcano, so it cools slowly underground. Then uplift continues and the solidified body is exhumed and exposed like this."
16cpc6,"I don't think religion should be allowed to ""own"" the concept of ""positive thoughts.""Aside from the source of some of the uplifting quotes you've incorporated into your mantra, how is the process ""religious?"" If there's a quote in *Star Wars* or *Lord of the Rings* that I find meaningful does it mean I'm incorporating magic/wizardry or Jedi/Sith teachings into my life?No. They're just well written thoughts from good writers. I think it's important to define a personal philosophy and pulling from other philosophies is a good way of helping yourself do that, but I'd hardly call it religious."
19290c,"I would say you need to create the god before you write it. If you don't know where its from, what its history is, or what its goals are you can hardly write a conversation it has. That's how it seems to me. The Silmarillion has a great creation story at the beginning which may inspire you."

196e2f,"2C-B. It's gentle, fun and uplifting. I haven't tried 2C-E yet although I will someday, but it's generally regarding as a more difficult and intensely introspective trip. Now it can be amazing, but for a first timer go for 2C-B."
17dhd6,Electric light orchestra - Mr.Blue Sky.I defy you not to be inspired while listening to that song.
18qzg2,"I'll probably be downvoted to hell for this, but that should be, IMO, inspired people. Hitler was a great orator, and he came to power at a time that Germany was broken by WW1. He inspired the people of Germany with his visions for the country.Disclaimer: I'm not by any means saying he was a good guy or discounting the holocaust."
170a00,5cm/second inspired me to get out of my house and appreciate nature and scenery. I really need to watch that again and renew my motivation
174upm,I love Mattias's playing. I'm really inspired by him and think he's a really fantastic guy with a weird personality. He has a whacky composition method which is refreshing to listen to. Only thing I can criticize is his tone which can be a bit thin at times.
17zmuu,Hey dude. I commend your noble commitment to lending a helping hand to those that look for it. I am also astonished by your sense of empathy in regards to what your friends and family felt and am inspired by the path you're trying to take. Is there anything I can do to help? Could we strike up a conversation?
5fmr35,"I'm on day 6 as well brother. I've had moments of flat line, but it goes away quickly. I think the key is having something to channel your energy into, something you can see measurable progress on.For me its working out, rebuilding my body and also writing.We're removing one of our main sources of pleasure, and suddenly, so its natural to feel that way. Got to find something positive to uplift you."

16rubg,"Jeff and Britta always seems like a regression for the characters, going back to what they used to be and ultimately a little destructive. When they are together, they don't to good things for other people.Jeff and Annie seemed to enhance both characters, make them want to be better. They both seem to drop some of their destructive habits to be with the other and inspire the other to ""help other People."""

17hypm,You inspire people to talk with annoying and bad accents.
193j4o,"Hearing this song on the radio was one of the most hope-inspiring things I've experienced. I liked Macklemore when I first heard him, but after hearing this song, I truly admire the man. For a white rapper to stand back and call out hip hop for it's hypocrasy took balls of steel."

178ks5,"It's the PC crap the government's pushing on usReally though, probably because she was the first woman to accomplish. I guess it's supposed to be inspiring when you're in grade school to think that someone did something great despite the odds.Also, what's more interesting to the average elementary schooler? A guy who flew across the Atlantic, or a woman who had to fight to get her pilot's license to do the same thing."
18d80q,[I wrote this FATAL character creation commentary months ago]( but lost steam and filed it away for later. Your post has inspired me so I've gone ahead and posted what I finished. Maybe I'll finish it off next weekend.

16k2aa,"Dude, relax. Just because you like teens does not mean you will like your kids when they are teens. Even if you do, it is a problem of 15 years hence, and not today. Today you are just being fearful of the future. I am also sorry to hear about your ordeal, but also inspired how you recovered, and even put that guy behind bars."
18kb9q,"Yea, its how I got into watching the bonds in like 6th grade. Actually, the novel silverfin inspired me to run Cross Country in 7th grade which got me into swim and a slew of other sports."

17vqh6,"as fellow short guy you are inspiring, keep it up bro!"
15u2ma,I thought I was coming into this post to see you praising him. Two and a half years is amazing! Why are you looking at that as a bad thing?Be inspired that he made it that long. You have to ask yourself why it hurt. Did it hurt because he didn't live to your ideals? He has is own ideals to live by. It sounds like you are turning him into something he is not.
88a2nv,"I know what you mean, I'm also very careful about my music. Prince, Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Alice Coltrane and my fave, Pharoah Sanders are all black musicians who make ""black music"" that uplift me. I also listen to a lot of Roy Ayers and Erykah Badu, Parliament. Stevie Wonder! There's lots of good stuff. Recently I've been into Sampa the Great and the new Tribe Called Quest album, so there is new stuff out there too."
637zba,If you want to uplift them then you'll have to colonize the planet before the game will allow you to do that. There might be some events that happen that can have some negative effects but they're usually pretty mild and more a minor annoyance than anything. The main issue is that before you uplift them their numbers will grow and they may occupy useful tiles you want to use.
16mq0g,"Arnold, my name is Ajmal i am an Afghan, you have been my hero and inspiration since the first time i watched your movie Conan the barbarian, i have never missed any movie of your since. wish to see you person one day.

18pik4,Your photos are incredible and I'm excited every day to see your view. Thank you so much for sharing your experience.Also your advice to young students about how you became an astronaut has been inspiring me. I'm struggling through many years of university and it's difficult to stay with it. You've helped me more than you'll ever know. Thank you.Have you had any moments on the mission where you have felt panic or fear?
17w3qh,"I generally disagree with ideologies and dogma that I consider unnessary abstractions. Why should I subscibe to a set of ethics/morals built up by others instead of thinking for myself? Yes others might be more wise and yes, one might get inspired or see truth in some of their teachings but there is also the danger that one might end up taking the lot of their teachings without much scrutiny simply because they agree with some core points."
18bhme,"I was a Peace Corps volunteer from 2010 - 2012 in Burkina Faso and I personally saw people come into my village to vaccinate people for Meningitis A.

And THAT adds meaning and purpose to life.Please do stay, Op!"
17c2dn,You inspired me. I went to CLG's website. Tried to buy a shirt. Paypal told me the recipient was unable to receive money at this time. For shame. I probably wont remember to return.
2z4v8q,The best way to protect the world from religious evangelism is top uplift them economically and with education. People who don't need to worry about their future have less inclination to turn to religion for comfort. There's a growing body of research suggesting a strong correlation between poverty and religion.
5wz8jy,"Lots of good suggestions so far. The *Uplift* books would be my goto on this.You might also look at *The Hormone Jungle* by Robert Reed. It's not so much about the process of doing genetic mods, but more about what has happened after everyone has done it and humanity is split into very different groups and cultures."
18vsy3,"Persis Drell. She was the keynote speaker at an women in physics conference. She was inspiring both in what she did (director of the Stanford linear accelerator, successful marriage, kids. She is proof to me that you can have it all) but also in her philosophy. During the Q&amp;A someone asked what one thing she would change about her life was and she said not a thing, because everything she had done led her to where she was today. It is not the mistakes that define you, but how you react to them (slight paraphrase, I apologise)"

7vykqi,"I vouch for Bali too, i packed my bike and stayed at the chillhouse in Changuu for a few days, they offer awesome enduro tours with plenty of descending and ""free on a friday"" trips to bali bike park ( just have to pay the transfer charge.. like twenty quid).

I don't see myself as either Trekkie or Trekker, I just enjoy watching the show here and there.

9634j6,"In his 1980s trilogy on this exact subject, author David Brin used the term “uplift” to describe a situation where an already-mature “patron” species used genetic manipulation and breeding techniques to bring other species into the sapient fold. Species were “uplifted” so that they could make use of tools and structured language to interact with other species on a highly sophisticated technological level.So for an Orangutan, he would probably be “Frank Orangutan-ab-Humanity” according to Brin’s rules. Or for the species as a whole, “Orangutan-ab-Humanity”.But seriously - check out his Uplift trilogy, it is pure-form HFY through and through."

I think it would really flatter your face shape and enhance your already beautiful features."
4nazlj,If it's in the center of a crater then it is a gravitational uplift formed while the crater floor was molten immediately after the impact. It's similar to [the way water moves]( after dropping something into its still surface.

17rn5w,Two years seems enough time to get to that skill level. I don't see how that's inspiring. But it's a great groove (like any Jamiroquai song).
15tgaf,this is so great to see! ive got about 20kgs im determined to shed and theres nothing more inspiring than seeing winners like you actually do it. you look beautiful and should feel very proud of yourself
5m14g7,"- If a benevolent extraterrestrial race followed the line of stars to visit and uplift our race, that would be positive. - Some random gravitational effect caused by the alignment of the stars that prevent an asteroid from hitting Earth. - A horoscope recommends the alignment of the stars to coincide with really good luck, but only if people donate to charity and it causes a spike in donations.That's about all I can think of."

Sorry!! In that case, search for crafts on Pinterest and you'll be inspired for days :)"
18oq7p,"Style - stylized art direction can inspire with a timeless design where as a simulacrum still has yet to overcome the uncanny valley (Wind Waker, Valkyria Chronicles, Killer 7, Jet Set Radio, The World Ends with You)Design - smart graphic design can lend to level design better than text in most cases (Portal 2)Something that stands out in the genre, avoids visual monotony - I would much rather experience say a post apocalyptic game during wartime that has a color palette other than genre cliché of brown or gray.

18lx0i,"City Pages published [this article]( in 1997 that raised what I thought were valuable concerns about Copeland and Sharing and Caring Hands.

3jzckv,"I can identify two aspects of this phenomenon:1. Meditation and introspection are good things and will help anybody.2.

I do eat in most of the time as I like to cook, I'm paying some extra bills like cable and internet, phone, etc. I get disheartened easily that I can't put away big chunks of money at a time. But, for some reason it's helpful seeing your percentages of savings. I don't think I could put away 20% of my income, but you've kinda inspired me to start smaller. Hope that makes sense, haha.

Blink, and you'll have to rewind to catch what he did. These are particularly remarkable:I think seeing one of their peers demonstrating his GIMP mastery should be inspiring for them."
1892mf,I would like to note that a nurse from the evacuation also sent me her story by e-mail after reading this. It was beautiful and inspiring. If you have a story to share about the Hurricane we would be interested in reading.

I really hope to read stories from you or friends! Thanks for the kind words!
17dhem,"Worship kind of doesnt do it justice for the people who actually respect him as a driver and man. Yes, he was the best driver during his time, but nowadays the game has changed and I think there are drivers today who are at the same skill level in the current car set up as he was in his car setup. Overall I found his views on life and the sport itself to be the most inspiring, which is why I chose to look up to him."

17nb4z,"I read this in an afternoon. I was incredibly fascinated to be reading the point of view of a man knowing his last days were quickly approaching. Its definitely not uplifting though, its quite a tough and tiring emotional account.

6w1kfk,"My real estate agent always suggested that that type of uplift comes from the intrusion of water from the subfloor which causes the wood to hydrate and expand. If you have water intrusion up into your hardwood, there's a good chance your subfloor is also soggy and you'll continue to get issues like this. As for a fix, getting your foundation redone and ensuring proper grade and ventilation will probably help to reduce the moisture issue. I wouldnt try to change much with the flooring until you can ensure it's not just going to get wet and ruined again."
173p0z,"Thanks for the free copy. Everyone should read this book. No other book I have read about Earth Changes is as clear and inspiring as this one. A real call to action both internally and externally. Marshall Vian Summers brings the truth, pure and straight to the point."

17mqis,"This is something I tell people when trying to get them to come to the gym. I always hear about how selfconcious all the other lifters make you. I was too. You just gotta learn to be inspired by them, not discouraged."
17f3c3,I think I may quit my job today and go for a ride. This was inspiring.
63thdm,The Uplift Books by David BrinStart with the Uplift War. It's a hoot.
18zn8q,"Because thinking hurts. Thinking things contrary to the norm is frustrating, isolating, discontenting and generally hopeless and loaded with ennui. And we admire the willingness of others to endure this in the search for truth. Such devotion to knowledge is inspiring."
71met5,"The Uplift series by David Brin is about humanity making its way in an advanced galactic civilisation where they are a minor race.A more recent example would be: The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. There is also a kids book called Terra by Mitch Benn, note that this is a kids book."
18iijj,I remember her at the Baylor-WVU football game in Morgantown a few months back. She is truly inspiring.
15w2gb,"This is what I LOVE about this fandom, the creative spirit and kindness of everyone is damn near inspiring and heartwarming."
3cqc16,"Lol. Every time it happens to me, I'm absolutely cool with it and I always give a compliment back. I think it's a lovely way to spread positivity! Women need to uplift other women :)"
985gdg,"Humans killed Xenomorphs through technology and superior numbers. In terms of physiology and adaptability to hazardous environments, humans are vastly inferior.Imagine if the xenomorphs had the mental capacity for complex planning, learning, and the usage of tools? Imagine if they were vessels for human brains?They are the perfect creature, most optimized for any situation within a generation, but they are ultimately animals. If they had human level intelligence and the level of tech humans had, they would make for amazing colonists and soldiers. That's why YT wants them, to uplift their physically perfect form."
80cfhg,"My belief in fiction is that an unlikable character can be made endearing by properly building up this character, adding depth to them and allowing them to redeem themselves, that a walking cliche can nevertheless be charming if well-written enough, that a good romance in spite of my usual loathing of such plots can uplift both characters without reducing one to said cliche and a character doing something inadvisably bad can have an amazing epiphany which spurs their character growth and make them become a fan favorite. Maki in my opinion is none of these things."
2lqlhd,"Snow Crash: Neal Stephenson (Cyberpunk, fantastic writing)Ringworld: Larry Niven (good world creation, short and easy to get into)The Uplift War: David Brin (Hard SF with some great concepts and neat battles, Brin is a physicist as well as an author)Ender's game: Orson Scott Card (not all enemies are alien! sometimes the enemy is us)Downbelow Station: CJ Cherryh (Best prediction of what colonization will really be like)"
1tp9iu,"Uplift series by David Brin is about gm to create intelligent races of dolphins, dogs, gorillas, chimpanzes and so on. Not so much about the technology, but more about how this impacts society."
4qtxxc,"Seeds of Hope by Jane Goodall. Wonderfully inspiring, fun, soothing, easy read. Non-fiction. Charity and Sylvia by Rachel Hope Cleves. Nonfictional account of a lesbian couple living together in 1700s America. First hand sources - letters and the like. It will uplift you when you read how accepting many of their neighbors, relatives and friends were of their relationship."
16czw2,"I'll admit I was quite inspired... Until I remembered everything I wear is either in XS or S, quite impossible to find whenever I go through thrift stores.A very impressive collection of thrifted clothing nonetheless!"
1839uo,"I just really liked the coloring of the old banner. It really gave it a feel of dawn or dusk. In fact, it inspired me so much that I will likely be spending a lot of time playing with filters for the actual game so I can achieve the same effect during day/night transitions. :)I really do like the other customizations though. Very clean and a subtle feeling of being unique."
1953qv,"Very inspiring, thanks for posting. Just went out and gave some cooked meat to the lower level players killing cows :)"
17r8mn,"This was the song I listened to and sang a lot during my last break up. It sounds childish, I know, but it is such a meaningful and emotional song to me, and I'm almost 30. Seeing someone half my age connect to it as well is brilliant. I get why the kids are snickering (they are kids, after all), but I hope this boy knows just how brave and inspiring he is. I never would have had the guts to do that."
16dmla,"Congratulations! I've recently crossed the Obese/Overweight BMI Border, I can't wait to be ""Normal"" next. You're inspiring :)"
15tiam,"Well, the first half of the match if rough. But then, during halftime, the coach gives an inspiring speech that lifts us up, and at that moment, the teammate that we thought had abandoned us arrives to tell us what he's learned about teamwork. Then we go out and use our new confidence and faith in each other to beat the January Blues, win the championship, and save the rec center!"
15v3av,"Hey Feliks, I just wanted to say that you are awesome man. I tell EVERYONE about you when they see me cube. I don't have a question, but congrats on getting the world record. Keep inspiring people!"
16r7xa,Your story will inspire more people to never stop trying. Congrats!
15tass,"I cannot tell you just how much more magical the books are than the movies. Before the books, it was an interesting saga and I enjoyed it but after the books it is a part of your life. The books will really show you the amazing world J.K. Rowling has woven and I must say because of the books, HP is so much more fascinating and inspiring. I would recommend them to non readers like you and hopefully you enjoy them as much as I have."
17q1j4,"Sartre's novels also explore existentialism. If you're interested in this philosophy you might also like to read up on Kierkegaard, who I found much more inspiring than Sartre or Camus."
180y6u,So.... when can I come over?! LOLThat's awesome! Enjoy it! And make lots and lots of yummy HP inspired food stuffs!
17o4ho,"Man I got fired up just reading this. I think some kinda inspiring soundtrack music started playing about halfway through.Talking to a few people already, it looks like things are starting to be set into motion, fam. Let's go to work!!"
18pik4,"Colonel Hadfield, would you collaborate with me on a recording of one of my compositions. I write music inspired by nature and use the planet as a recording studio with solar powered recording equipment for my project, *The Sunrise Review*. I am preparing to record beneath the surface of the Earth in Mammoth Cave, KY and it would be amazing to have a part contributed from orbit. I promise it can be simple and fun. You can hear some of my previous work here www.solarpoweredmusic.com"

1729k8,"First of all, thank-you so much for doing what you do. The first time I saw you guys was at Bonnaroo in 2011. That show changed my life. I'm serious, I live differently each day because of that show. I honestly have never been more inspired in my life. You set the standard. I hope that one day I can inspire people as deeply as you inspired me. My question for you is if you could give someone only one piece of advice about life what would it be?"
174m9k,Congratulations!!!! Ive failed a couple times but its posts like this that truly inspire me and make me believe i can do it!
17jife,Congrats! Hearing stories like this inspire me to push myself further- thank you!
15vzyj,"Its why Valve hired their own tinkerers, and said 'how much you need to build a tinker palace to tinker some more awesome stuff?' Gaben and Valve inspire me...well just enough make me forget the depression sometimes."
17othj,"&gt;On his deathbed, Lombardi told Father Tim that he was not afraid to die, but that he regretted he could not have accomplished more in his life. Vince Lombardi died at 7:12 a.m. on September 3, 1970. He was 57.Am I the only one who was inspired by that? Even after everything he did for football, everything he did for his players, he still wished he could have done more. Makes me want to go out and accomplish real goals so one day I might be able to say I made the most of my life."
196hhz,"For me...it's the people I'm around. In high school I found if I talked or hung out with ""right"" people, family or friends that were optimistic or in a good mood, it usually uplifted my spirits. Depression is something you shouldn't have to go through by yourself. Stay strong buddy :)"

6ylo6c,"Your first game should have like 3 empires and no fallen empires. Just expand, tech up, and learn the systems. The game will be a bit boring since there's not many other nations for diplomacy, but it'll allow you to learn. Make sure to uplift a species, enlighten natives, and genetically engineer some species to see how those systems work too."
16gh59,"I'm Korean and I wanted mine to be barn swallow-themed, inspired by the Korean folk tale of kindness begetting happiness. The wedding is in late summer and swallows can be seen during this time. However, I didn't want my wedding to be another rustic ""put a bird on it"" cliché. I want the style to be more sleek and modern. So, I created a [brush]( on Illustrator with different silhouettes of swallows that I traced. I used this to calligraphy our first initials as our wedding logo. I'm hoping to get more use out of these bird silhouettes."
232z62,David Brin's *Uplift* series has some epic sweep to it. Because star-faring dolphins.
5zlvra,"The species in David Brinn's uplift series are some of the most unique and we'll explained aliens I have encountered in sci fi. He explains their evolution and how that evolution is reflected in their culture and personalities. My favorite are the jophur/traeki. Donut shaped rings which stack to form group consciousness. Evolved from scavengers kind of like fungus, they have very slow reaction times, because of internal arguments."
17x9jp,"I've got a few. I tend to listen to ""power metal"" when I run. Good rhythms, very intense, fantasy-laden inspiring lyrics, and a whole lotta rock.Powerglove - ""Dr. Wily's Theme (Mega Man 2)"" Dragonforce - ""Heart of a Dragon"" Elvenking - ""Trow's Kind"" Stratovarius - ""Eagleheart"""
5oyt0q,"David Brin's Uplift series is how I imagine the universe is populated, with races of creatures ~~enslaving~~ apprenticing other species for a perios of a few tens of thousands of years and mucking about with their genes.And the galactic library where literally everything has been discovered, and new discoveries are just bits of data that were previously lost. When species X does devastating weapon Y, so and so species looks up in the library what countered Y 2.6 million years ago and deploys that."
16mq0g,"As a beginner bodybuilder, you are my biggest inspiration. Your 6 rules to success have been helping me motivate me to be a better man. Since you came up with your 6 rules are there any others you have come up with? Your life has been truly inspiring - Andre"
173zhs,"He's Italian, not Spanish. Even in the movie he was Italian. He speaks in Italian in the film for crying out loud!Sergio Corbucci &amp; Franco Nero's Django inspired many other Djangos in his lifetime. Countless film knock offs, and even a Hideo Kojima game!"
16prd9,That was a beautiful article. Sad and inspiring at the same time. Especially sad about how long it took him to get over his mother's brainwashing about his father.
6costa,"Uplift and Xeelee are both great series with similar level of 'hardness'. Baxter is more focused on ideas and wild physics, Brin does better characters. Xeelee also wins on the epic scale, given that the series literally begins in the first instant after the big bang and ends millions of years in the future, and spans tens of millions of light years, with a few alternate universes on top."
6var7q,"in lower level education, include moral studies and focus on practical aspect in science, math, etc. In higher level education, give focus on practical aspect and on research which are directly applicable to the Nepal society and the world. For example, universities in Nepal should work on what is applicable in nepal and how they can ease or uplift lives in nepal. In general, education should make a better human being."
1vgj6j,go out and do things that uplift your confidence and get you excited about your life. when my first love and i broke up i took it reallllllly hard.. years later i have had an incredible life traveling all over the world and having other beautiful relationships. i always count that as an important thing to have happened. if it had worked out i would have stayed in that small town and supported what would have been a crippling relationship.. everything is potentially a blessing
17r7re,"Very nice work. They are inspiring young Muslim girls to be educated, have fun and explore different careers. It sends a very nice message to Muslim parents and kids, especially the girl children."

3syzxj,My community has gained great strides but we have distance to travel - I hope that that we not only gain greater acceptance but we never lose sight of those who have supported us and help uplift the lives of others who like us have felt the sting of discrimination. The work is not done until we are ALL treated as equals -- Thank you for your post
161cal,"General: Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam could inspire you but beware. A lot of people try to hitch themselves to that wagon, if you get me. Although its very plain what is said, people use it to try to amplify their own made up nonsense. So adopt the Vedic method and find a proper teacher in one of the four sampradayas. More specific: imho, If you carefully study the texts of Gaudiya Vaisnavism you will become a better Theist. Jaiva Dharma by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur is highly recommended."
16pmwe,You look great. Nice job. Keep up the good work. You inspire me!
18shou,"This is pretty much what the juicing diet a la *Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead* is all about. Anything substantive is removed from your diet, and you only eat micro nutrients. Yes, it's sustainable, but you definitely miss food, and I wouldn't do it (again) unless I was obese or sick.If you haven't seen the movie, I definitely recommend it (it's available on Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime). It's a neat diet and an inspiring movie."

We encourage all comments and critiques, only asking that you be constructive in some way. Otherwise, we truly hope you enjoy and look forward to your comments."
162xkc,You should embrace this as a exploration to being a better artist. If you see something that inspires you it's most likely something that you can make your own. If someone was inspired by my work I would be flattered.

167pqh,Thank you so much for being such an inspiration to thespians and performers everywhere. Even though the movies you have produced are animated they still inspire and influenced many people to go into the entertainment industry as they grew older. I wish I could have seen this AMA when it first came out because you are long gone but could you link me your facebook?

18oqau,"When I was a teen I once dreamed that my grandma (that IRL was the sweetest person ever) and grandpa (who IRL died when I was 4) had a secret room under their house that they used to butcher people. I went outside into the back yard and found her helping him perform a vivisection on a pregnant woman. I was like ""Woah, grandpa's alive! Neat."" and proceeded to help clean up the floor and walls around them while they ""worked"".Strange dream, but it did inspire a great short story."

He took a week off after the super bowl loss and is already training hard again. He is setting new standards for hard work; he doesn't seem to take anything that he has done this year for granted."

7p6b2a,"Is there any satisfying self-improvement you can do at work? You've got to be there, available to people, but that doesn't mean you can't be improving your life in other ways.Work on your body. Get two workouts a day in. Work on your mind. Learn Latin. Work on your soul. Pray. Meditate. Write letters that serve or uplift people. Improve the world. Found a foundation. Lead a movement. Publish something. Create art. If you're delivering a solid performance in your role, and you have some slack, make something you're proud of."
87mf61,"I've found that not all is bad about one's ""old life"". Hang on to the friends and connections that have supported you and uplift your life. I've made the mistake of ditching everything to achieve a clear slate, but I lost more than I'd gained. Eventually I rekindled my positive friendships."
178cfj,"Another thing: Some times, when you feel uncreative and can't improve on a track ... it's because it's done. Upload it to Soundcloud. Give people the joy of your music. You'd be surprised how the feedback and ego-booster of putting your music up there gives you creativity. Lets you see the track from outside. Be less dramatic and perfectionistic and let you create even more. Worst case scenario: You find out later there actually was room for improvement. So, that means you're inspired. Get those last details in and release it as a re-vamp or whatever. All good!"

[The video]( of the address is available, and for those who have access, the entire address is printed in the [February 2013 _American Historical Review_]( I thought it was a fascinating, sobering, and yet strangely inspiring look at where the profession is heading."
18qdfk,"There are a lot of great, sincere, big comments and such. All I can say is make it a point to talk to strangers. I don't mean, how's your day, how are you kind of conversations. Get some meat of who they are, no judgments, no expectations. The world becomes that much more inspiring - it grows and shrinks at the same time. It requires no money, just a commitment to see the world in a new way. The stories you hear, people you meet...if you're open, it makes the world a little more amazing."
18xl9v,I am glad for you that you went back to school instead of giving up. Inspiring.
17tfgz,"Remember that Satoshi Tajiri was inspired by his insect collections as a child. The whole mechanic of Pokemon was built around the stage-based metamorphosis of real world insects, termed evolution in the games and beyond. Now, this idea could be cool for an introduced evolution method. Say there is Galapagite, the Darwinian Pokemon-- who evolves through a series of tasks or by building up stats etc."
17mlx9,I just enjoy the idea of a love story in reverse. The way Future Ted tells the story of how he met the mother makes me believe that everything I'm doing right now has impact on what is going to happen years away from now. The best example is S04E22 Right Place Right Time. It's just inspiring for me personally. It's the same with S06E03 Unfinished - Some episodes just have a special place in my heart which is why I love the show and still do in S08.

4z9tsq,"You seem fairly well read! But have you read *The Uplift Trilogy* by David Brin?Made up of *Sundiver*, *Startide Rising*, and *The Uplift War*, they've got a lot of fantastic alien species and cool tech, alongside a central political plot where Humanity are galactic upstarts, resented by many species but supported by a few key ones. *Sundiver* is a ""smaller"" story than the other two in many ways, but the whole trilogy is inventive and fantastic."
174pkm,"Just for the record, I wasn't criticising Rowling, I love Harry Potter, and if she was influenced by Tolkien then that's great, LOTRs is very inspiring. And if Tolkien was inspired by Arthurian legend then that's great too. I just like to look at ways in which writers are influenced. Perhaps my original discussion should have said which parts of Harry Potter are influenced by Tolkien rather than copied."

It was an amazing experience, and I still get frisson goosebumps whenever I listen to a group perform it. That performance is my #1 choir experience ever, and ultimately why I chose to pursue Music Education in college. I just want to say thank you for your music, it was truly inspiring to me."
16y5td,You're welcome and congrats! Posting your story will also inspire others as well. The cycle continues!
17jdlj,"I would suggest you rotate the positions for awhile so people can try out different roles. I think the only way to really figure out something like that is through experience. Also, do Fire rituals...Water rituals...Air rituals...Earth rituals...and then your members can discuss which rituals they felt were the most effective and inspiring for them. Affinity for an element is something you are sometimes born with but it is also a relationship you form with an element over time."
7zsat4,"The Uplift War series by David Brin (Startide Rising, Uplift War, Brightness Reef, Infinity's Shore and Heaven's Reach). Great Sci-fi adventure, great characters &amp; very HFY.

5schew,"Want to get motivated? Uplift your spiritual condition. I don't necessarily mean religions and deities, but I do mean rituals at the very least. I have a prayer that I recite each morning to remind me of my ancestors' struggle. It is very similar to the prayer recited by the Haitian slave and Vodou priest, Dutty Boukman, at the start of the Haitian Revolution. Do all you can to liberate your mind and body in honor of God and your ancestors."
16faaz,"As someone who constantly worries that I'll eventually lose everything that makes me ""me"" because of a frontal lobe disorder like ADHD, this is pretty uplifting. I mean, I will still eventually get senile and/or die (everyone does), but I'll live longer in the interim!"

16qtm4,"I've heard different views on this - ranging from it's all Baha'i to it's all secular inspired by Baha'i. In the end, I don't think it makes much difference: the punishment for victimless ""moral"" crimes, such as drinking alcohol, is that you lose your administrative rights - your right to vote or be voted for and to attend Feast. The punishments for ""normal"" crimes is on a par with current law. I'm not worrying about it either way."
7y718d,I am a big fan of David Brin's Uplift series.
17bru1,"that tone is amazing. I am obsessed with tone already, but this has inspired me to (maybe) make my own pickup."
176wlu,"Here's an imgur album of photos that have appeared online. (Personally, I find the first photo of the 7 guys in plain clothes with the cake particularly inspiring.) * Also: ""Dedicated to the Journey of Nishiyuu 2013"" (Youtube slideshow): *"
17vt39,"Beneficial, and yeah I'd say it's important, but I doubt it's necessaryIt's good for finding what you like, trying new things, getting inspiredNot necessary. Music isn't extremely important for a lot of people."
16ltcx,Do not stand at my grave and weep I am not there. I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glints on snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. When you awaken in the morning's hush I am the swift uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circled flight. I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry; I am not there. I did not die. Mary Elizabeth Frye
1612f6,Ur style is amazing the insightful inspiring words and general vibes subperb! Thank. Would be wicked to hear some terence mckenna in a song. Just a thought. Stay golden my friends!
18bhme,"Hi Bill, I'm often inspired by the example you lead with your philanthropic efforts. Could you offer some advice to the layman about how to be more active in the global community?"
16brk9,"This piece was inspired by a fellow redditor who posted a long while back. I can't take credit for the concept but I don't know who to give credit to. Whoever you are, thank you! I had a lot of fun making this."
17rmch,"These ideas are too good, I wouldn't be surprised if we actually inspired some future crimes"
16fiyg,"Read the bible and really study it. Truly ponder the *divinely inspired* actions written inside. Try to be as objective** as you can be, about the actions and writings inside the bible. Think about it."
72287c,"It adds a whole new dimension to everyday life, and can uplift and pleasure the sense of smell like great food to the taste buds. The average person might wear an everyday cheap designer and call it good, but imo that's equivalent to eating the same food everyday when there's so many delicious foods and fragrances out there to enjoy.Also it's something to attach memories to, so that anytime I reach for a certain scent I can be transported back in time"
162m76,"Sometimes i let the vibe and the mood that the beat gives off inspire the lyrics. I take the freestyle route a lot, but at points, it feels as though I'm just sitting in redundancy, so then i try out writing to an actual topic or form as you said. You asked if it doesn't really matter and that is just dependent on you and what you want to do. It all stylistic opinion, so you really can't go wrong here. It all depends what you're writing/rapping for."
1648ah,"Seems very Gervais/office inspired type comedy. I'm enjoying it and finding it quite funny so far. EDIT: After watching the first two parts hes my two cents;The premise is good, it's funny and the writing is quite clever at times. BUT You've got to be careful that you don't make Nathan a complete nob head that no one likes - give him a couple qualities that people watching will be able to empathize with so that Nathan's character has more depth. Think David Brent/Warwick Davis - Obnoxious but likeable."
15rjlf,"Sounds like a good enough reason as any to see a movie. I'll try to go see it, to get further inspired to have adventures."
15tgaf,"Wow!! Congratulations. Hopefully that picture can inspire other people looking to lose weight. You look like a different person, for the better of course. Never ceases to amaze me how good looking over weight people become when they shed the weight."
2kem1h,Skating can really uplift people (especially girls) in bad areas of the world. [Skateistan](
18bhme,Hi Bill as a young man whom has always been inspired by you and what you do I have to ask what do you think is one of the largest growing job markets in today's society or what do you think will be the next big industry? Also do you have any strong advice to give about growing up in todays world? Also 100 bulbasaur sized venosaurs or 1 venosaur sized bulbasaur?
18smuh," This is very inspiring! Please, would you tell me what resources you used to find your work exchange gigs? I have never heard of this before but would like to know more! Also, what would you estimate your out of pocket cost was to take this trip?"
6fg8qr,"*The Martian*, of course. *Fire with Fire*, by Charles Gannon. In the ""Uplift"" universe by David Brin, almost all of humanity's higher tech came from aliens, but a lot of it is about not using alien tech."
17exrj,I hate most Self Help books because they have a very simplistic way of looking at things. More like you do this and your entire life will change. I somehow do not agree with them.However I liked Viktor Frankl's [Man's Search For Meaning]( which is not necessarily the typical self-help book kind but a very inspiring book nevertheless.
16yhom,"Rest peacefully good Sir. Stories like this are why I love communities like Reddit. For all the trolls there are around, there are so many more kind hearted people willing to help others and people like Jake who inspire us to do something with our lives. Deepest condolences to OP, his family and his friends. Jake has left a legacy that will not be forgotten. He did more in his 23 years here than most do in a long lifetime. Off to hug my loved ones and appreciate life a little more now."
17d7ro,"I think we need an album of your awesome work, and also a place to give you all our money. You've got a very eye-catching and inspiring style, it's fantastic. :]"
197ji0,Just wanted to say thanks for getting me interested in different food and cultures and inspiring me to be a bit more adventurous. You showed me that you can like good food without all the pretentiousness.
18o2v9,"Fiction is often grounded in reality.That said, I don't think we need to compare an angry ex-cop with a fictional DA with half his face burned/melted off.Giving a cop killer fame and notoriety can only inspire others to do the same thing."
2tx6q7,For whatever reason the depressing songs uplift me in those moments. I guess because it makes me feel like I'm not alone in my sorrow. Songs like Today by Smashing Pumpkins or No Alarms by Radio Head are the first choices.
743ytw,"I think the beauty world means a lot of different things to me. Some days makeup is there to uplift my confidence, others it's a toy to play with, others it's a way to meditate and relax. Beauty to me is harmony. Harmony that comes from within and harmony that comes from the outside too. Beauty to me is calm, quiet and discreet. It's there to make you happy, if that makes sense."
16jzs4,"Well my ultimate dream would be becoming a working artist, I want my photography to inspire others. To create images that tell weird and wonderful stories and be able to exhibit my work! It would be pretty cool if my work was used as research by students like I look at others now."
17wtqj,Redditors tend to be kind of melodramatic and psudeo-intellectual...Which makes unexpected wisdom like this that much more uplifting. Thanks for sharing.
194ebr,"Congratulations, you have won the game. Would you like to save your current progress? Y/NBut in all seriousness, this is inspiring and full of winning."
17rswq,"I'm sick of the posters this inspired. They're all over facebook.I do like this one though, we have it in our kitchen"
197ji0,"Just wanted to say, you inspire me to travel! Every time I am taking a trip somewhere, I try to look up and see if you did an episode in that location, to give me ideas for where to start exploring when I get there!"
18azyn,"Awesome. It's basically been redefined and lost it's original meaning of ""awe-inspiring"""
18zhw7,"I loved the Xenogears soundtrack. I really felt like they induced emotions so appropriate to the scenes. Flight was extremely uplifting and gave you a sense of heroism. Grahf's theme was perplexing, haunting and equally mysterious. Id's theme was creepy, and haunting. Also the music box theme were really endearing and warm, as well as the Sophia/Nissan ones."
14z0au,All of these are inspiring. I myself am considering making a Pokemon Origins series.
189m0q,"Yes! And maybe let inspire you from those awesome mods with plenty of new, awesome biomes!"
6qfthd,"Zen IPC should be seeing a 10% IPC uplift from what I've read. AMD had been talking about low-hanging fruit.Instead, I'd like to see a process maturity and easy breaking of the 4ghz wall.A few people have gotten past 4.1 and 4.2ghz, but when you compare it to a mature uarch like skylake that can boast 4.5ghz, that's where most of the performance disparity comes from.Overall, IPC of Zen is _fine_. I also hear that IPC is roughly equal to skylake due to improvements in AGESA and platform developers; so who knows."
18j85t,"I think the thing that Rudy Gay brought was change. There's now certain expectations from the team, and I think it's inspired the rest of the players to bring their best game. I think each player has improved in some respect (even if not consistently over games). Sure he's been missing a large percentage of his shots, but we were always playing close games (Bulls, Heat, Hawks, Orlando). Now the thing is we have a closer, and we have a team that *believes* they can win a game."
16v21q,"Sad and inspiring at the same time. Good luck, you are on course."
171ad0,"Many people are inspired to write things of a spiritual nature. Whether the biblical authors (most of whom are unknown) were or not is not really the point.The Bibles are our primary text, but they are not divine nor should they be called the Word of God. They are a product of the Church."
239nq6,"My retired military father (68) cut his hand on a table saw a few weeks ago. He's much better, but could def use a pizza to uplift his spirits. Thanks for the offer!"
16ufvq,"Ultra-dark chocolate, darling! Impossible to eat too much, as it becomes bitter and cloying after a few bites. However, you get the uplift in your mood from the cacao, more so than if you ate milk chocolate, and fewer calories. Also, keep books handy. Books are wonderful diet aids, as you have to use both hands to hold them comfortably. Knitting is wonderful, too. Drinking tea, rather than eating food, is a flavourful way to have a taste, consume something healthy, and have a new way to enjoy a moment.Also, what parker214 said."
8uf5ol,"ugh this moon had feeling sooo messy last night but i’m trying to look at it as my final “low point”. I’m letting go of what’s not meant for me and anger. after the year i’ve had, i really hope this full moon will really be the one that’s turns it around for me. like i said i definitely felt a lot of energy last night, hoping it’s what i need to uplift me to better things"
190r61,"Washington is a truly inspiring figure, and most of it was unintentional."
17vzrb,"So...anything remotely neat or uplifting is un-Islamic? What a boring life...Does explain the suicide bombers, though."
16c25e,Congrats! Just finished my first week clean and feeling great so far! Inspiring to see other people succeeding at their efforts! Keep up the good work! So many exclamation points!
17ortm,"Swing dancing. People think it's just a thing to do every once in a while or something that was kind of fun in high school. I...LOVE...IT. I want more. I travel to weekend long events of dancing because it's so freaking awesome. I'm talking swinging out to a song and hitting all the breaks. Hitting a mini-dip right with the music, and inspiring your partner to do something which spawns more creativity in your dancing. Swing dance...going dancing tonight! Thanks Purdue Jazz Bands for getting that 1930s sound!"

16exx3,Well... you've successfully inspired me! I'm definitely going to do this.
15uxqa,There is definitely a noticeable difference! Thanks for the inspiring post :)
169f33,Whenever I hear about someone not drinking while grieving I am so inspired. You let me know that it is possible to go through anything without alcohol. Congratulations on your first birthday and your 4.0.
64r91e,"If they'd have stumbled upon Humanity at the same time as they'd have stumbled upon the Rachni we would've ended up as a science or cultural experiment. They wouldn't have needed to uplift us, they would've watched with morbid fascination at our descent into the Dark Ages and slow crawl up to today's technology.They would probably have reached out to us when we reached space, as the Asari did with the Raloi."
71unge,"In David Brin's Uplift series, every spacefaring race was uplifted by a patron species except for humans (probably). Some races see humans as an interesting curio, while others see them as a heresy that should be erased from existence. Conflict ensues."
16mq0g,"Sir you are the greatest thing since George Washington. You have inspired many people in the world. If I could ask you one question: If you were president of the United States what would your administration be like? what would your policies look like for the environment, reducing the debt, jobs, and lastly uniting the nation"
15tg0q,Oh my beautiful Argentina! After having traveled for quite a bit I can honestly say the Moreno glacier is one of the most awe-inspiring things I have ever seen. In par with the glorious Mt. Fitz Roy close by.
17923y,"Thanks for that, that was inspiring! Way to stick to your guns and follow what you feel God is calling you to do. The #1 criteria for choosing a church should always be ""Do they teach the Bible and do they teach Jesus as Savior?"" Church choosing shouldn't be about how many people attend, what programs they offer, or what kind of worship they do, but about Jesus and His gospel."
177fzp,"I have tickets to your show in Minneapolis in April. It's three days before my birthday and I am very excited to see your performance. By the way, Heima was very very well done. Thanks for making such beautiful music. EDIT: I want to hang out and have a beer with you guys, because Sigor Rós is so inspiring. It makes me awestruck."
18u6d3,"This egg is far more interesting than a white egg, as you can tell from all the comments it had inspired. It belongs on a more appropriate sub"
182p2l,Well said. You guys are definitely the most helpful stream I have found(not to say there aren't others). I think you have also inspired many to be more generous as well. Lots of people donate millions of gold and full sets to be given away just for the love of the game and to help people. Keep doing what you do and ignore the idiots and hate imo(easier said than done I know).
17pq7y,"Wow, how have I not heard of him? It's really inspiring to see him play that layered sound by himself. Amazing voice, too; actually gave me goosebumps listening to him"
16lhlg,I really like the idea. I think it's a great way of driving discussion and inspiring all of us.
33alkp,"Well, they might turn human planet into a tributary planet. Humans get to live in peace, but must make regular contributions to the master civilization - give them resources, produce stuff they need, work as soldiers.If that alien civ also works like our capitalist culture, they may uplift us to get a 7 billion sized boost into their economy and production."
3iod8s,"So it's a bit far out as far as the tech goes, but David Brin's Uplift War has some awesome space battle scenes and a lot of fun world building"
182vvc,Just wanted to leave a message saying I appreciate your sense of humor and hard work in Community. It really is the most uplifting intelligent and hysterical show I've seen in a while and I always encourage friends to check it out. There's not a single episode the creators and cast have Britta'd.
16yvj8,"Berserk's my favorite series. The closest thing I've seen to it is Legend of the Legendary Heroes. It's not as dark and less serious, but it was still good and it was very obviously inspired by Berserk.Samurai Champloo's by the same guy that did Cowboy Bebop. Different genre and setting, but his style is recognizable in both."
190276,I've actually done this a few times. If there's some one I know I've played with and we did well I sometimes will go as far to send them inspiring messages while they are in promo games.
4iviy7,Build a station around the planet with a construction ship and choose the uplift alternative.
18a011,I've seen suggestions on here before of giving the artist the song or lyric and asking them to draw something inspired by the song. That idea sounds amazing to me and I may try it one day. You'll get a much better piece than some flat text that no one reads because its just text.
1748yi,Following the trend here. I was inspired by the Inception cinemagraph poster I saw a few days ago and wanted to make my own. Sorry if these kind of posters aren't allowed here..
16m6cj,"[Hans Zimmer - Time (We plants are happy plants remix)](check it out, sounds quite uplifting to me. but it depends on your musical taste of course."
9560fr,"There's always something in EVERY style of music to find.

16ler4,"Very inspiring post, thanks! Be more human and will to connect with other people is something that I lost somewhere during my addiction. It is time to man up."
1958yp,"Jesus. Now, I don't know what really went on all those years ago, but his life inspired his followers to create a new religion which has changed the course of history. The world today would look radically different if he had never been born."
16g9fk,Fallout New Vegas probably doesn't seem very beautiful for many people but there is something about it that is just kind of awe inspiring
18zrvl,"Learn a few blues progressions and find a blues jam! It's a good way to get stage experience. Also a good way to play with people, which is ultimately inspiring!Don't give up! It only gets better!"
17oqgg,That's pretty much how I get a lot of inspiration. I watched Mike Birbiglia's Sleepwalk With Me and it inspired me to write jokes that were more personal than what I had been writing before that. I ended up re-writing some jokes I had and coming up with new ones and it went over really well. That's just the way it goes sometimes. I've had similar moments with Kyle Kinane and John Mulaney.
4z7jo2,"There's also an 'Irradiated' trait that you can sometimes find on pre-sentient species. If you uplift them, you can use the them to colonise Tomb Worlds."
1o8t1m,"For DH, [Aston Hill]( near Aylesbury is a good place. Its about 2 hrs from Nottingham. There's no uplift service but the runs are quite short so push up isn't too bad. There's also Bringewood near Ludlow, there are a few uplift days run by [Pearce Cycles](For a weekend riding there is no better place than South Wales. [Bike Park Wales]( looks awesome and the XC centers around there are great."
16y4uz,"Sad part of this in all the NFL playoff talk from this weekend and craptastic NBA games, this probably won't make Sportscenter, or get any press outside of the direct hockey world. This man is inspiring."
15ukxk,"I admire Eric Schmidt, and kim jong-un taking a rational approach and allowing for economic and social liberalisation would be an uplifting thing for the world to watch because of the extreme positive effect it would have on NK's situation in a short time frame"
192xmb,"About 6 years ago when I played MapleStory, I watched some animations people had made using the in game sprites. This inspired me and led me into learning numerous programs pretty extensively including Adobe Photoshop, Flash, After Effects, Premier, and Sony Vegas. It's funny how such a terrible game could lead me to develop some pretty useful skills."
6vlovw,"I think Ecclesiastes spends a great deal of time exploring the nature of earthly life in and of itself, without the uplifting and sanctifying effect of a life in proper relation to God. The few more ""positive"" notes in Ecclesiastes seem to invoke God. Thus you get something of a lesson of, ""Life is fleeting and meaningless by itself, but submitting to God can uplift it."""
38pmbp,"Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse.Christopher Hitchens"

1819lx,"I generally find the seniors out there biking, running, and doing triathlons more inspiring than the pros. I'm 40 years old. I'm never going to be an elite athlete, but I truly hope I'm still out there getting it done in 30 years. I have many fitness goals, but my most sacred involve being healthy for life."
3osbfk,"Location and logistics. Too many people are starving, and transporting all the food required to feed them would be very expensive. It just is not practical. We need to uplift them, help them build their own infrastructure and agricultural sectors. It's difficult because many of these places have weak property rights and lots of theft, so few want to invest in their own land to do so."
18gj5m,"As a young college student, this was very inspiring to me. Thanks for the reminder and for sacrificing now to make it easier for those of us down the line. :)"
16duj6,"Do you sit down and try to force yourself to compose or are you randomly inspired by things in life and spontaneously start composing? If the second choice, what are things that inspire you and allow you to write amazing music? What goals would you like to accomplish as a composer and what keeps you motivated to keep going?"
17ycdb,"We all die eventually. If your work can inspire people to fight for your cause, how is it not worth risking your life/dying for?"
182srq,this inspired me to make my first attempt at animation - ever![Rainfall](
18r5ji,"I am always very impressed and inspired when I see an overweight person running/working out. Just remember that running is not how you are going to lose weight. It's the simple formula of intaking less calories than you burn. Running will help you burn more calories, but if you just eat them back nothing will happen.Here are some resources for you, and good luck!/r/loseit /r/c25k"
4kzj68,"You've been missing out. Freaky Styley and Uplift are some of the weirdest, funkiest, most enjoyable albums I own. Their debut is great too, but the demo versions sound more organic than the album cuts. It was 1984 and, more than any of their other albums, it sounds of its time."
16x36c,"I spent my share of of 3.5 hours in that tunnel that day as well, and while I might not have been able to see anything, I still remember it as one of the most randomly inspiring events of my life. So many people from the far reaches of the country coming together in 19 degree weather to see an historic event....felt pretty 'Murican to me."
15tc6h,"Don't get me wrong, I understand how trivial our trials and tribulations are compared to the vastness and the awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos, but to call 'life' on this magnificent planet 'insignificant' is a bit blunt, don't you think?"
17dyz5,"You look fantastic! Just want to say, at 5'6"" not sure if you can AFFORD to lose another ten pounds :) Good for you, so inspiring, you're gawwgeous!"
18d0ls,God do I love firefighters. Their dedication is really inspiring and that particular incident must've haunted him for months.
168ch9,Your comics did indeed inspire chuckles from me .... they were severely needed and much appreciated. Thank you.
17fdvl,"FANTASTIC JOB! You just inspired me. I'm at 220 and my goal weight is 165.Read your routine, and it's cardio,cardio,cardio, weights, eat healthy.And only 6 months...wow.Simple enough!"

18321f,"I'm going through the SAME exact thing! And to be perfectly honest I don't think there's anything that will replace that 5 minutes of pleasure. I think it's only going to get better when we get to that point when we actually look at ourselves as ""non-smokers"". Right now we're smokers who have decided to quit. I know this isn't the most uplifting comment, but I'm being real here."
18mwdr,"this video should inspire every citizen. when Americans learn to identify the chicanery employed by wall street bankers and the﻿ federal reserve we, too, will be able to peacefully resist their methods."

2sq8y9,"Some are good. I'm helping in a small way with a civil service IT apprenticeship scheme, where they earn only slightly less than us graduates and after 2 years can qualify as a full developer having done a lot of front-end and back-end development (with a possible substantial professions pay uplift)"
177fzp,"Sigur ros is by far my favorite band. I live in Vancouver and am goin to see your show in San Fran in April. While I am there, I plan on getting a tattoo with some of your lyrics. Do you have any in particular that were awe inspiring to you or that has special meaning? It would mean so much to get a tattoo that was meaningful to all of you as well."
1i7c4p,"The laws of nature are the scientific pattern which the Universal Father God set forth in the realm of time, space &amp; matter. All of us unique Personalities are presented the opportunity and choice to have a personal relationship with the Divine Father, to uplift our earthly lives and to become heavenly citizens.The earthly life is the start of a journey toward cosmic adventures and celestial achievements. The Urantia Book reveals such spiritual discoveries."
17qkpl,"As someone working toward becoming a published writer. Congratulations, this is inspiring to hear."
18qz4t,Seeing a comic told this way is somewhat jarring. But as a guy who has wanted to make a comic his whole life it is also inspiring.
15z1ru,"The art styling is incredible and inspiring, and in-fact inspired some artwork that I did recently and hopefully more in the future. I've watched a bunch of videos on it to hear the soundtrack and see the art syle and story, but I haven't had the means to purchase it myself. Thanks for the awesome giveaway!"
15u0vo,"Well, the Qur'an, which I believe is the word of God, tells me he's a prophet and to follow his message, and other than that, from what I read of him in the scripture, he seems like a really amazing, enlightened individual and his moral teachings are nothing but inspiring. It's clear he's gift from God to the world, and I hope I can be more like him."
18lgxj,Thomas Paine.... Common sense is one of the most important phamplets in Amerivam history. It was said that there were more phamplets of Common Sense in the country in 1775 then there were Bibles. Common sense inspired a nation. After the Revolution Thomas kept speaking out against governments and religion. He was criticized and shunned from societies (American and French) but he still stuck by his convictions. I keep his collection on my bedside. It's truly amazing and somewhat scary how relevant his words are.
2isjbo,"That's kind of unfortunate. If you can you should sit with them during their lunch and fellowship. Our church runs a homeless ministry here where we don't preach anything at them at all. We hand out food, clothing and pray for them if they want it. The actions of believers mean more than anything you could say about Jesus. The best thing you could do is respect and commune with them and uplift them as brothers."
2hjmov,"I find that typically every strain has a ""peak"" feeling as well as a ""lingering"" feeling. Some have faster onset than others but, generally speaking, all strains fade into gentle relaxation/tiredness once 4-5 hrs in.

You don't have to like it, but it helps to appreciate it because it is beautiful and sometimes otherworldly. If you learn to appreciate it, some shows will leave you awestruck.To all those who are against high fashion in general - unless you make your own clothes, chances are you're wearing a form of it right now."
17t90d,"Thank you for this inspiring post it is a wonderful example of why this community is exactly what each of us who admit we have a problem need.In your words are the blueprint for each of us to create an individual plan that will take us out of the fogginess of debilitating addiction and into the light of self control and self actualization.I am printing a copy of your post to study and then to create my own set of goals and rewards that will lead me day by day out of self imposed hole.Thank you brother, this community works....."

It's essentially an Armando, except instead of real life monologues, you read pieces of poetry, stories, or song lyrics you wrote when you were around 13 to 18. The audience loves it, because you're all just laughing at how bad a writer you were, how lovey-dovey some of us were, and just how angstsy we all were. And then you just do scenes inspired by your pieces."

My boyfriend and I haven't opened up our relationship yet because we are still in the discussion phase and I am not quite ready yet (I know I won't ever be TOTALLY ready until it happens, but I think there is some more reading I would like to do to help me develop strategies to own my emotions), and reading posts like these bring me hope that I can someday experience compersion like this! &lt;3"

What I love most is probably seeing the references that I never got. Star Trek has inspired Futurama a ton so seeing some of the original inspirations (Amok Time, Operation: Annihilation etc.) is really interesting."

5jl7qo,There is an argument to be made that Africans who were sold into slavery bound for the US won the lottery. They escaped brutal oppression by African warlords and avoided the hellish existence of Caribbean and South American slavery. Then white americans fought a bloody civil war to free them and grant citizenship. Many programs and policies followed to uplift this minority group. All in all a better outcome than any other nation offered.

Also, any chance of a show in Ireland? Keep up the good work :)"
8c7abj,"It's really hit me this past week after I made my own post, read through others and realized that my marriage is turning me into someone I never wanted to be. When you find who you think is the love of your life, you are expecting them to uplift you, guide you, encourage you. I've never once felt that. I've only felt discouraged, ugly and lonely."

17mkus,I HATE YOU AND AM SO JEALOUS!!!!Ha ha seriously though that is awesome! I'm really happy for you - if I could meet the man that inspired me to learn music theory and appreciate music for the emotions it evokes I could die happy. What is you favorite Nobuo song?

Vegeta simply wanted to ignite the Saiyan fire within Trunks. Remind him of his heritage and that he belongs in a tree with the strongest warriors in the Universe. How rising to meet every challenge should be his goal every single day. That was Vegeta's message, he wanted to uplift his son's spirit after a year of defeats and sorrow."

17ly0j,"I hope OP does not mind if I twist this a bit. My proudest moment is that I go to the gym every morning. I am, to put it kindly, rather mediocre in the gym. However, I used to weigh over 300 lbs. Because I go to the gym, I have managed to lose 130 lbs. As people see that I have managed to lose 130 lbs, I have been able to inspire folks to lose weight. That's my proudest moment."

3ik2u0,"I think the government can blunt all these protests once and for all (and also do the right thing) by introducing quota for economically backward students irrespective of caste. This will not only uplift thousands of people out of poverty, but also make any such caste-specific protests redundant."
15tww6,"It's great that publicly-funded renewable energy projects are getting positive press, but I feel like most people are interested in the overall financial picture - cost of the solar panels, gross savings for the year, return on investment sort of stuff. In particular, it's unclear whether the $37k check was for gross or net energy production, and how much of the total cost of the school was sunk into the solar panels themselves.Still, great to see a story that will hopefully inspire other school districts and public infrastructure projects."

RG3 I fear will be injury-prone, and that was before today's game, but skill-wise may be above the other two. Wilson is a great combination of great skills and inspiring character, but I'm not sure yet how that translates into a guy who can lead the team.In short, given thee guys with enormous upside, I'd stick with the guy who's currently making me pee my pants with excitement."

Anyway, I was wondering: What have you accomplished to get you where you are now, and what advice could you give, in terms of finding opportunities to compose and staying inspired to write, to get an aspiring composer (like me) off the ground? If it helps, I'm still in high school. Thanks!"

16vi78,The University of Limerick has received over 46 million euros in donations form one billionaire in the last 9 years. Putting 15.6 million euros into this bridge is a great way to boost campus image (which will attract more students) and it inspire students that cross it every day. The bridge is also part of the 'Great limerick run' marathon making it part of the community as well. Money well spent I'd say.

That technology is not a result of the uplift but something we did for ourselves, so I think the Traveler got the idea for Ghosts from human technology. We made AI, the Traveler thought it was pretty rad, and when the Traveler had to try something desperate, it made little AIs of its own. Their circuitry is printed on Light instead of silicon, but it's based on our designs, and thus similar to Rasputin."

It doesn't uplift, it makes them afraid of the world and feel like they're not doing enough although they already give their all.What I notice the most is how emphasized devotion to the church and leaders is compared to actual things that improve and help life."

8uzwsb,"David Brin's Uplift Saga is along these lines. Though the alien species are not all benevolent, it depicts the human race through first contact and beyond in a manner where conflict is a result of a larger agenda rather than the point of the story. Client races get 'uplifted' into sentience and spend 10,000 years in servitude as a result. But Humans burst on the scene without anyone having uplifted them... or is there a mysterious benefactor guiding them the whole time?"

185xdl,"Dave, I have been a fan of yours since I was 8 years old and first heard the Foo Fighters. It's what got me drumming for real. Thank you for changing my life. You are the man! What's it like inspiring a generation of musicians?"
18j493,"*The night is darkest before the dawn* Pretty much sums it all. Very inspiring and well-written. Thanks my brother! Especially liked this part: ""When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, when it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.”"
16a8vl,My artist pals seem to get inspired by observing the work of other artists in their field.
17i5mp,Stephen King's The Dark Tower series is loosely inspired by the Arthurian Legend and it's pretty easy to get lost in the world(s) he creates.
5l7vx5,"You've made a brat of yourself, by doing so much to find out what you'd like to do. I'm not saying it in a rude way, just to convey that you've unintentionally trained your brain to crave ""interest"", and dip at the merest depletion of it.Pick 3 of your strengths and weaknesses, see how they could help with jobs and take a leap. Whenever you lose interest, remind yourself why you started in the first place and surround yourself with people who can uplift you and keep you focused. Also, try therapy; that could help."
15wtf9,"Mine was Jimi's Machine Gun on his Band of Gypsys album. All the emotion he sends through that guitar was inspiring, to say the least. Why can't you play anymore? I work in the oilfield, where your hands are in constant danger, and always figured if anything else, I could always play my square neck Dobro with a slide attached to my nub, or a pick attached to the other one, should anything ever happen...Edit: link"
172bn6,Go on holiday. I find myself most inspired when I'm away from my home studio. Take a guitar and write the old fashioned way with a pen and paper. If you don't write anything at least you had a holiday.
16srub,"""Praline and Chocolate Ice. Gotta get over it. Gotta forget."" *Battersea* by Hooverphonic.The song is (to me) about a girl who was in a relationship where she absolutely loved her partner, but the he had so ruined himself that she had to leave him, lest they both be destroyed. Even though she still loves him with all her heart, she must force herself to move on, and to forget. It's both uplifting, in that she has the courage to move on, and heartbreaking."
165dop,"Have you tried vitamin D? I find that a playlist of heavy metal or drum-heavy music can be inspiring.The un-smart ways I've perked myself up is to chug an energy drink around 45min before (has lots of substances, and they make it hard to sleep)... or down a pack of highly-sugared candy (bad for macros and leaves me wide open to a later glucose crash)."
4fwrml,"Most mayoral candidates have thoroughly expressed how they feel about gold, food and production. But, a society without culture is an incomplete society. What steps will you take to uplift your city and make it awe-inspiring?"
185xdl,"Fresh pots!!! Playing in the foo fighters and nirvana, you have had the chance to travel he world. Has there been any place you have been that stands out as being more inspiring than the others? Any place that is a must visit whenever you plan a tour or trip?"
5oym1t,"Present days: ATLA/LOK meets Thundercats (2011).Ancient days: XCOM meets Starship troopers.The humans of my world/s are much more genetically diverse. This is because they descended from a multi-solar system confederation. RIP aliens.Aliens are just incapable of many things humans take for granted. Most would never be able to escape their planet. Humans and Greys agreed to uplift these species together.Bonus fact: Greys, the only species on our level, just came out of a nuclear world war when they took to the stars."
17r77w,"I was really inspired by these pictures and this story, so I took the opportunity to learn how to colorize black and white images in gimp. I know the results aren't perfect, and there are a lot of you who could do a lot better, but I'm really proud that I learned a new skill today."
16p6zh,Thank you for this link. It's a fascinating and inspiring article.

174h84,"This is the most inspiring thing that I have ever read. Literally made me cry. I wish I was as strong as you are, but I just can't imagine telling my friends and loved ones. I hope everything goes well for you.And thank you for posting this. And to everyone who commented. I'm glad we can find support in each other."
177fzp,"thank you so much for making incredible, inspiring music! :)"
18nwf6,"Knew it was going to be this one :) It's probably my favorite moment in the entire trilogy. I love when a movie (or book, tv show, etc.) can really make you think about real life and inspire you. It becomes more than entertainment at that point."
16fqop,Thanks for posting. My aeropress has been neglected for a while. This definately inspired me to put it to use this morning!
3o03f3,"*Sundiver* always struck me as similar to *Ringworld*: Group of aliens and humans go on Space Adventure and some non-adventure fun ensues because Aliens Have Some Secrets.If you like that kind of stuff, then you'll probably like the remainder of Brin's *Uplift* series, the remainder of Niven's *Known Space* books, Gardner's *League of Peoples* books and Vinge's *A Deepness in the Sky*."
17kanf,"[Frank Herbert's Litany Against Fear]( has always helped me through hard times. The Litany Against Fear is the mantra of a group of powerful women in the Dune books called the Bene Gesserit, who have achieved superhuman powers from mental and physical training. I find it beautiful and inspiring and hopefully it can help you too. We're here for you. &lt;3"
18h6o3,"Although this doesn't directly answer your question, the Rockies are still uplifting, and will likely rise more before they erode back down."
5c7lll,Love this thread. Thank you for a much needed uplift OP
7ba94k,"In my fantasy story number of sentient civilized races has to remain constant, or else gods will be killed by The Creator (kind of over the top existence that checks up on the world from time to time). Dragons tried to overthrow gods (thinking they will not kill them in return) and got themselves extinct. In panic gods tried to magic up and uplift some animals, but it wasn't going well. The Creator however thought the idea was hilarious and so he refined their creations into a real race of ""Aniks"" - people with some animal body parts."
166q7p,"This series was seriously uplifting. I constantly struggle to understand where the kind of ""creative spark"" some of the great creators of our time have had, has come from? When you think about certain things though- images, sounds, stories, etc- one does realize the familiarity they conspire. Wow, it is wonderful to know that not ALL the geniuses of the world created their masterpieces completely solo, but maybe I'm just weird I'm not sure haha. Either way these were amazing, thank you for posting them!"
6eqs8u,"In Dune there's​ a galactic empire like Foundation. Earth is irrelevant.In A Fire Upon The Deep, Earth is forever stuck in the slow zone where FTL is impossible and is therefore cut out from the rest of the galaxy. In the Uplift series Earth and humanity join the galactic society as almost pariahs. The story is from the point of view of humanity (and related species), but Earth is definitely a backwater."
18x54s,"Happy Cake Day!I have several real friends now from here.I am writing more because of the Goodreads book club writers and their damn inspiring talent.I'm reading more by far.I laugh way more.And I have WAY more confidence because I think that there are people in the world who are honest and kind - it's not just a big materialistic, everyone-out-for-themselves world - even though it seems like it sometimes."

17ik6g,"I was crying with laughter at this, it was brilliant. Definition of uplifting, I love that these men don't take themselves so seriously that they can't still have fun in their 40s."
18kvog,One thing that I've learned in my short lifespan is that you cannot change people. You can only change yourself and inspire change in others.
5t5ri2,This is too close to creationist claims. Also their model has two major flaws. It shows water cutting through lose sediment but the grand canyon is cut into layers of rock. Secondly a catastrophic event wouldn't explain the oxbows and columns in the grand canyon. Gradual uplift and down cutting is still the superior model.
3inmi8,"I think it would largely depend on what our experiences of space travel had shown us so far, if we had met other species we'd look to them for an example on how to handle (or not) non-warp species.If we find ourselves alone though and suddenly find we are not I can see there being a push to uplift the world we find, get another space faring civilisation started."
37jayv,"Hey there friend, I have seen family members and friends get married recently. I hate those types of events. These are often excuses for everyone else to ask when it's 'your turn.' Forget that. Choose your own life. For this reason, I've been absent to a lot of family gatherings, and I've had many turn their backs on me as a result. Sometimes distance from those who don't actively uplift and enhance your life is needed, even when it's family. I wish you the best, and I'd totally take you up on that hug :)"
18pik4,"I don't have a question, but just wanted to thank you Commander Hadfield. I tweeted a question to asking you what is the most beautiful thing you've seen while in the ISS and you answered back within a few minutes which blew my mind -- mostly because a) you answered and b) I 'talked' to an astronaut who's orbiting Earth. Thank you for taking the time to answer my question and countless others (including this AMA). You're doing a great service by inspiring and informing so many people to stay curious and continue to dream."
16tag1,"I had a few of these too, but nothing like your impressive collection. I do still collect toys to this day, you've inspired me to capture some pictures. Thanks for posting!"
2p30a0,"If you like Science Fiction, I would recommend the Well World series by Jack Chalker or the Uplift series by David Brin. I really enjoyed how both presented possibilities for the greater universe being populated."
1ct2pi,"Examples of allogenic controls are:Climate, tectonics, and sea level change. These are ""external"" to the depositional environment.I believe that controls in regards to sedimentation are talking about rates and supply of sediment. e.g. Tectonic uplift will send more sediment to a basin. This is allogenic.e.g. Alluvial damming will stop the sediment supply. This is autogenic."
5c1k5k,"Uplift Society Club: Some of its members are summoned across the multiverse to uplift less sophisticated society than their own because they are the most well suited heroes.This causes a panic back on Earth and a media firestorm.Meanwhile, the summoned heroes across the multiverse works to uplift civilizations of different stride. Then, they finally come back, with whole new tech and magic, even.Not sure what to do with this, so I am just throwing it out for consideration."
5w7x69,"Take away their protectorate status, liberate them and therefore give them your ethics, the make them a protectorate again.And when 1.5 drops, just indoctrinate them before you uplift them."
16dwxe,I'm super impressed and definitely inspired. Maybe I'll have a look tomorrow!
1658w9,Congratulations on your transformation! You're really turning your life and health around. Very inspiring. Enjoy the hike!!
161bsy,"Dude... You have the same addiction as me. I found that video like 2 weeks ago, i've listened to it every day since. It is a great track for just sitting back and pondering questions of life, most of them inspired by the game itself. Recently, i've been questioning what exactly humanity is, not just in dark souls but in real life. Good times."
18bhme,"What prompted you to start the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation? Also, what inspired you to make vaccination such a focus for the organization?"
187fx6,"The Colonel Runaway speech in a good man goes to war. The premise of the whole episode is still awe inspiring for me, because how big of an army can the Doctor raise if he called in all of his debts."
15v8ml,"Tell me three things you love about yourself. This was inspired by Rob Brezsny, and first tried out on a road trip from Atlanta to Burningman in 2006. It worked so well at bringing people out I their shell, that I've used it extensively since then."
16zol8,I'm sorry you lost some plants. Perhaps some of these people will be inspired to grow something.Everything here is frozen. Can't plant many vegetables yet. Good luck with the repairs.
16g0iu,"My favorite artist has a song called 'Threaten me with Heaven' which his elderly father in law inspired when he became ill. It's basically the end of a journey for a couple who has been through everything together.When I heard it, I thought about a soldier or a fireman, someone always in danger, and the hardship felt by someone who cares for them."
17x06y,"Unless you are prone to psychosis I wouldn't worry about it.It might be good to look at how you relate to people and life. During part of your meditation, it can be helpful to visualize people who are in your life or anywhere in uplifted, healthy, happiness.Meditation is not meant to cut us off from everything, but to help us experience it in a deeper more meaningful way.Keep going and but make sure you keep loving too."
17v4nj,"Hogs of War. I'll never forget that game.It brings back so many good memories, now that I think about it. I was feeling rather sad, but now I've been uplifted. Thanks :)"

164i85,Beautiful demonstration! It takes a lot of guts to get up there. I bet you inspired so many people. I always love the regional events because they bring so many different people together. Congratulations!!
6ps947,"If you want darkness and pain, give [Where do my bluebirds fly?]( a read. It will uplift you, drop you straight to the ground, stomp on your heart, then tease you with happiness again."
6e6v90,"I never really looked up the song lyrics and listened along but damn that hit me hard in the feels.I'll take a stab at what I think it means or what it's about. To me, it seems like a personal song directed at a specific person. The lyrics sort of dances around trying to cheer up this person and uplift them and let them know that they are there for them and that there is a way out."
6s8zs7,"Maybe David Brin's ""Uplift"" books could fit this definition. While intelligence isn't rare in them, ""natural"" intelligence is. Almost every intelligent species was uplifted to intelligence by some earlier, other species. The occurence of a species that wasn't uplifted, but evolved naturally (humans) is one of the core points of the books."
1679xu,"God is the protagonist in the world's most popular fiction story. Main character's usually inspire and positively effect the audience. It's good to see you taking control of your life, whether through the god within you or your own self respect. Hope everything goes well!"
17noe1,"[Avril the 14th by Aphex Twin.] (It's an incredibly simple song -- only one instrument playing for two minutes -- yet it manages to be both a complete expression *and* remarkably moving.While Mozart can be awe inspiring, and Rachmaninoff can be huge and intimidating, and perhaps either might seem a more logical choice than mine... I don't know that there's another piece of music that is so accessible and yet so successful."
17l7xk,These Powerpuff Girls inspire a different response than the cartoon did...

18tz0s,"There are always more people to meet man, they are everywhere. Just try to enjoy life, and not always be wanting or desiring something. Just forget about those things and be happy; the rest will come when you do that.If you're joyful, positive, nice to be around, and an inspiring guy; then eventually you're bound to attract a girl with similar interests. So just keep going with life and be positive :)"
18rl8e,"This is actually a quite old story (but a good one). Updates can be found at . If you are like me you will find it offputting that the woman writing the blog (Dale's mother) is very religious, buy basically Dale is not a vegetable, but has serious mental limitations. He appears to be till improving, able to walk and talk and laugh. Not ideal but still uplifting!"
18cydl,My biology teacher in high school inspired me. I took a degree in Biology and have maintained a deep interest in the natural world throughout my life.

5i062n,The Maldives are coral islands. Coral starts to grow in reasonably shallow warm water and stops growing at sea level. Sea level changes and geological uplift can then move the coral tops slightly above sea level but it’s unlikely to get very high before it is eroded back.
16172u,"No advice but your story blows my mind and is incredibly inspiring for me to continue doing the right thing. All the best, and extra kudos for helping your mom out! You restore my faith in people!"
165kin,You look amazing! Way to go on setting an example. Your son and the rest of your family should be proud of you. Your success is inspiring.
16xewl,"As someone who was once mormon and had to share her testimony like ever month, my advice is just to let it come naturally. Let the nerves show, let the emotion run. People will be able to feel how scared you are, and watching you push through that and share your story will inspire other people to share their stories. You are not alone, there are probably other people in your youth group who struggle with the same problem. You are so very brave and strong. Good luck sir or madam!"
17wexl,"It also makes an amazing hand soap! I love using it in my hand soap dispenser, the smell is so uplifting!"
94ctab,"""has always been an escape *for me* and an emotional uplift during hard/weird times in my life.""That's the important part of your statement. If it's an escape for you (as it is for me--and music, in a broader sense, is for practially everyone), don't let other people's opinions tarnish that. Take what you like and leave what you dont. Reddit is a forum for the free exchange of ideas/thoughts. That includes negative ideas/thoughts. Just read past them."
16d4qc,"1. Self employed2. Working in my home office, from 9-10 to 3-6.3. Pros: Working on my own time, being at home, being able to go anywhere at any time. Cons: Fluctuations in income.4. I don't have specific role models. Famous designers and average Joe's all inspire me if their work is good.5. Photography6. Very, and not at all. There are a ton of wannabe designers that only last for 6 months. If you are good then there is PLENTY of work to be had. If you are mediocre, it will be hard to make it.7.

16t3w2,"Well I'm not exactly a great song writer, this is what I have found.I seem to come up with them independently. Like I'll have an idea for a riff while I'm playing, or I might randomly get inspired with an idea for lyrics. When I have an idea for lyrics I write them in a notebook, ""freestyle"", or ignoring meter or rhythm . Then I try to match the mood with a guitar part and I rewrite the lyrics to match the meter/rhythm of the song."
174p8b,"This seemed really exciting at first and then it turned out not to be an RPG at all. But now I'm inspired to write a pen and paper RPG for my gaming group that actually gets us out doing things, so thanks!"
16yo9i,"For a workbench, I highly recommend something Roubo inspired. Find this book and read it. On the cheap, follow this: Other than the lack of a tail/end vise, it's a perfect start. I'd also probably do a different face vise, but we're splitting hairs.Neat trick I've recently discovered, special order beams from Menards. For $100, I can get a 16 foot 6x10. I figure after planing and cutting it in half, I should end up with a 5"" thick x 16"" wide benchtop."

68yymh,"Heavy emphasis on friends and brotherhood.When I was in my first band as a teenager; we were very close knit; Hell, we related to Uplift and Freaky Styley so much we *thought we were* the damn Chili Peppers.Those two albums were the soundtrack for most of our shenanigans.So I guess essentially it's nostalgia thing for me."
1vgc7v,"I think there all sorts of Christian music in all sorts of genres...but I think that the average Christian radio station exists to uplift people with ""positive and encouraging"" music to help them get through their day.Though I may personally lean more in a Skillet direction, I don't think there's anything wrong or fake with mainstream Christian radio."

And I feel great!Thanks for the inspiration :)"

1djpeh,"The most alpha thing to do is be nice to him. Showing any sign of anger or jealousy only makes you look weak and insecure. You should be so confident in yourself and your relationship that you have no problem with treating the guy like your friend, because he does not even register on your radar as a threat. Nothing he says or does is a big deal to you. It's much more attractive to women if you uplift and help people instead of being rude and treating someone badly (even if they may deserve it). Good luck!"
7hm9hr,"For me the mood uplift of DXM is like what I thought MDMA would be like. I've rarely had a good time on MDMA. The one time I had an overall good MDMA experience, I see how MDMA is different. There's a greater complexity of emotional and sensory experience on MDMA. DXM simplifies those things."

3pymqx,"I'd identify an individual of exceptional intelligence and talent and an undying will to uplift the marginalized, the oppressed and the abused and I would give my life to grant that individual eternal life and invulnerability.

60fhne,"""Children of Time"" by Tchaikovsky (not so much hard science, but speculative approach to humans trying to uplift another species) ""Three Body Problem"" by Cixin (the trilogy asks the same questions about life in the universe that Blindsight does) you could also try ""Cryptonomicon"" followed by ""Baroque Cycle"" by Stephenson. (basic computers, cryptography, science. log winded but hilarious, if you like his style of humor)"
16fqrw,"Fiction: Dom Delilo's White Noise. Its a fantastic book in that regardless of your opinions, it will almost certainly find a way to challenge them. Its fiction, but barely; it mostly consists of essays and monologues on evil, consumerism, media, collective perception, faith, and death. Non Fiction: King Leopold's Ghost. An in depth account of Belgium's brutal colonization of the Congo throughout the 1800's. These are the events that eventually inspired Conrads Heart of Darkness and subsequently Apocalypse Now, but surprisingly few people know about them. A great demonstration of the relationship between human nature, power and cruelty."
183vlx,"I love that you wanted to share this part of your life. Not only do you do amazing things for the world, but you can inspire us to do more too. :) thanks for your work. Horses are amazing (and a little intimidating) and it is good to see them happy."
1mzzx1,I always appreciate when my SO compliments the way I do my makeup...it's such a positive way to uplift your girlfriend! Simply tell her the great work she did and how talented she is with application. You can also tell her that you love how she takes care of herself. There is no way she could take offense or get defensive about that. Plus...a woman never turns down her man telling her how beautiful she looks :) Good luck!
4gbfd7,"We are here with you, struggling along side, you are not alone!I don't know where you stand with your beliefs but my suggestion try to find a church to go to, there are usually good people who can uplift you with kindness. Go around check some out, if you don't like one move to another one, until you find a right one. I would suggest look for some nondenominational church."
15uhgr,"I love me some Amorphis. They started off as a fairly typical death metal band but have recently made extensive use of clean vocals, with occasional growling for emphasis, often with piano backing. Most of their lyrics are inspired by the Kalevala and their songs have this beautifully evocative melancholy quality. One of my fondest music-related memories, up there with some happily-remembered concerts, was hiking through the woods in Sweden at nightfall as snow fell all around, listening to Amorphis on my MP3 player."
111gxp,"I love the Steampunk Tarot by Barbara Moore, she and Aly Fell did an amazing job. It's quite the chatty deck! I also love the Favole Tarot which is a more Marseille inspired deck and a little trickier for me to read. For the spook lovers out there Lisa Hunt's Tarot of Ghosts and Spirits showcases a spirit or ghost on each card. The little white book it comes with even gives background on them. It's probably one of my all time favorites. Those are my top three. :)"

1772sj,"Take a literature course and an art history course, no matter what your major is. Even daytime tv and ads for Dunkin Donuts are inspired by the greats. It may not necessarily change your tastes, but you will learn how to appreciate and interpret culture. At the very least, you will catch more references from movies and cartoons than you ever thought possible. Best case scenario: you will never look at anything the same way again."

17xfc9,"[**This Guy**] ( spoke at one of my company meetings a few years back. He was a big help for me to stay focused and inspired. My wife makes fun of me when I listen to the daily CD but I don't care! ""GOOOOD MORNING!"" -Boaz"

18mge6,Thank you so much for this wonderful tale! It's warmed my heart and made me smile. I could listen to stories like this all day. The more the better. I hope other's reading this will be inspired to share their own happy endings.
83b4w5,"*disclaimer: This series is in Russian.*It has been quite a while since I’ve read it, but if I remember correctly [*Слово о драконе* by Павел Шумил]( (~550k words total) should either be rational or at least not have too many disqualifying bad writing tropes.*(spoilers)*It had technological uplift, colonisation of new planets, interdimensional travel (I think), some worldbuilding regarding the nature of the dragon species, etc.The protag of the first set of books is somewhat MarySue-ish."
18pyyw,"The one particular quote that stayed with me is ""Should I kill myself...or drink a cup of coffee?"" It was by Albert Camus. It didn't change anything, it wasn't meant to inspire but just said something that was there in reality, n my mind. Dude made other good quotes as well."
174pkm,"The way I see it, Tolkien borrowed from Anglo Saxon, Germanic texts and Northern European/Scandinavian lore. **But** it his imagination, forged with inspiration from texts he studied, that inspired many (if not close to all of them) fantasy literature authors who are very well recognized this day, such as JK Rowling. It is not without reason Tolkien is often called the father of modern fantasy literature. I agree with what others are saying, though. Comparisons between Rowling and Tolkien have been done so many times before, and it **is** rather unnecessary."
16e39m,"I know I'm probably not the first to say this. But I am personally inspired by this submission and a lot of the comments here. It gives me a safe, warm feeling knowing that there are so many strong, brave people out there. So from me to everyone here, thank you. And i really mean that."

Whew! I think I can go sleep tonight with the conviction that humans are wonderful beings. What's your story, Reddit?"
2x8kfy,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is by far my favorite book. I think a Pink Floyd song that makes me feel similar to how this amazing book made me feel is Echoes, probably my favorite song ever. There's just something about these 2 works that wake some deep emotions in me, both make me feel hopeless, sad, but also uplift me at the same time. The emotions that these wonderful pieces of art evoke in me are hard to explain, i can only hope someone else can understand."
17r49g,"Very uplifting! Strengthens my plans to find energy companies to buy stock in, once I build up the surplus funds (and that won't take much longer).And an estimated 1.5 trillion barrels of oil in Utah, equal to estimated world reserves... daaaamn."
16e3tn,She's such an icon to all of Canada's youth that end up watching Sunday afternoon's CBC Sports! Watching her race in St. Moritz and other crazy place was so inspiring!
18eniu,"Look into RMCAD (Rocky Mountain College of Art &amp; Design). They are a great school in Denver, CO and offer many of their programs online (including Graphic Design). I've gone through the admissions and enrollment process and everyone is incredibly helpful, and they will always look for ways to help with costs if needed. If you ultimately decided to go with them and switch to an on-campus program, the transition is easy and the campus is outstanding and inspiring. Hope this helps!"

15tirf,"Mr. Greene- HS art teacher. He inspired and disciplined us, and at the end of the year awarded 3 students (myself included) with Free Summer Art School Grants. He helps kids to this day- awesome person!"
7oi7c3,"Though it's unclear when exactly the experiments started, in the 2500s there were ongoing projects to uplift various Earth animals, the most prominent and successful of which created a species of intelligent super-octopus. Eventually one of them escaped and became a civil rights leader, exposing the project and her abuse."
6iwjon,I've found the engineering jobs are in the ballpark of similar private sector jobs in the Denver area. When I account for the 24% uplift while deployed I come out WAY ahead of where I was previously in private sector.
18e4nw,"David Brin's ""Startide Rising"" features a ship -- crewed by dolphins uplifted to sentience -- marooned on an ocean planet.Niven/Pournelle/Barnes wrote ""The Legacy of Heorot"". Although its protagonists *intended* to end up alone on the planet to colonize it, the book still has the flavor of a shipwreck story because our heroes end up fighting for survival, clearly wishing they could simply get back off-planet."
323ait,"You should hangout with the right people. People who make you feel good about yourself and will uplift you, etc. I'm not saying stop hanging out with non christians, but be with people who are genuinely your friends."

194rsz,"Ignore the haters out there. No one can judge or tell you how to raise your kid. So the kid bought some candy every time he got his allowance... he's a kid! Worse things have happened for Christ's sake. I think that you are a super dad for teaching him to save for something greater than immediate gratification (candy) by age 3. That is a HUGE accomplishment and will inspire me with my two year old. Besides, if he hadn't had the candy, how would he realize there are other, bigger, and better things worth saving for?Well done dude!"
18vggz,Happy Birthday Kurt!Heres an [improv song]( I love and find super inspiring!
16sjdl,Wow what a great article and inspiring man! Thank you for showing me that article because I had not gained a new level of respect for this man.
18b6fo,"Not a band, but a person. Chuck Schuldiner went from really dark metal about death and diseases to progressive metal forms with more inspiring lyrics in later albums such as Symbolic. This change became even more apparent with his work with Control Denied."
16bmjm,"The fact that those children singing the Obama song still gets circulated shows just how pathetic they are. Apparently some teacher writes a song for kids to sing about the guy who happens to currently be the president of the united states, a guy who is, objectively, quite inspiring, and it just HAS to be part of some giant liberal brainwashing plot. I guess it's best not to let reason or logic get in the way of a good persecution complex."
185xdl,"Questions:What inspired you to make a movie? Does your family have a major influence on your career?Worship: I saw the Foo Fighters in Tulsa, Little Rock, and Memphis and really liked your show. Best of luck with the movie and thanks for all of the nice music, Dave."

193g08,"They inspired me and my buddy to form our own band. We honestly love the music we make, and we don't make it for anyone else but us!

3gwp4w,"Volcanic fields around Albuquerque, New Mexico are pretty cool and the Sandia mountains. Big Bend National Park in Texas is cool (not really... Kinda hot). Carlsbad Caverns. Guadalupe Mountains. Pedernales Falls. Devils River. Palo Duro Canyon. Llano uplift area, enchanted rock is always crowded but there are lots of metamorphic/igneous outcrops around, particularly at Inks Lake. Driving from west Texas to the east through the Permian basin onto the cap rock is an interesting contrast."

9247ux,"Yeah I know this isn’t the right place to genuinely offer a non anti-dog opinion but if you’re truly asking rather than just facilitating a group to agree with you, dogs absolutely can offer emotional support and just because you cannot personally understand that does not invalidate how much they can help people. There’s literally countless examples of dogs being used to uplift moods. For someone who feels lonely and/or hopeless, having a pet who cares for their well being can be quite warming."
17f5a6,Inspiring. Grats. Friends like that are almost impossible to come by. *Little bit of faith in humanity restored* (that was NOT sarcasm)
18sj34,"Went to a fancy health-food store one day, and looked at their bulletin board. Saw a flyer advertising something called a ragtime society. It looked interesting, so I went to their little get-together. It inspired me to get back into playing the piano after a 10-year hiatus. I started practicing again, and now I perform at ragtime festivals and concerts all over the country. Health food is important."
17nslo,"That is a truly remarkable woman, &amp; they're both SO beautiful! You are so blessed to have such inspiring women (&amp; a sweet little girl) like that in your life!"
18rblj,Thanks so much for taking the time to do this today. You guys are really inspiring. Thank you for everything you've done for music.
16br8u,Really wish the Vibrato tour was heading overseas as well! What did you think of the newer songs? i personally thought they sounded very Zappa inspired.
75ngpw,"The Xenophile FE basically has the ability to create life. And I don't mean a clone lab, I mean literally create and preserve a species. In Limbo, I don't think we have their genetic coding, only their brain scans, basically. Downloading them into a brain implant in a presentient is redundant when you can just build a robot and save yourself the time of essentially killing a pre-sentient pop you can uplift later."
16w5y0,Nice work! It's tales like yours that inspire me to throw less away.
18cm3k,"John Holt's ""How Children Fail"" and ""How Children Learn."" [Ken Robinson]( is probably the most charming and entertaining speaker on the topicI believe that reform is no longer a useful goal. Dissatisfaction with the results of the system have inspired over a century of reform with little benefit. Rather than attempting to reform or fix the system, it is time to consider that it may be the system itself that must be discarded. I would like to go into more detail, but am in a bit of a hurry. If anyone is interested I'll do so later."
7dg4f7,"I’m absolutely with you. Parks and rec’s sense of optimism and enthusiasm was palpable, and I think the writers did a magnificent job building the world of Pawnee and the characters that live inside of it. The message that our friends and family uplift us and make us better people for knowing them really resonates with me, and it makes me appreciate this silly 21 minute comedy show all the more for it."
35kany,"The Uplift Universe is a fictional universe created by science fiction writer David Brin. A central feature in this universe is the process of biological uplift.His books which take place in this universe are: Sundiver (1980) Startide Rising (1983): Nebula Award winner, 1983;[1] Hugo and Locus Awards winner, 1984[2] The Uplift War (1987): Nebula Nominee, 1987;[3] Hugo and Locus Awards winner, 1988[4] The Uplift Trilogy (sometimes called the Uplift Storm trilogy): Brightness Reef (1995): Hugo and Locus Awards nominee, 1996[5] Infinity's Shore (1996) Heaven's Reach (1998)"
16bq23,"&gt;I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value.Great words, man. Simple words, but great words."
2rcw6l,Uplift war is alot more fun than startide rising; read both of them in Dec. I have to say I really enjoy Brin's books! Reading BR right now; not quite sure what to make of it!
1onfbr,"Not a scientist, but as I was commuting this morning I was thinking of my own AskScienceDiscussion question which would be: ""What experiments are under way to increase the intelligence of non-human animals towards human levels.""So there you go: my 100,000 year experiment would be to [""uplift"" dolphins, dogs or chimps]("
3w3pqk,"CRISPR's just a neat new cut'n'paste technique - it doesn't offer new insight into what genetic tweaks will uplift your dolphin buddies. You could with some certainty say that you won't get uplifted dolphin buddies *without* a reliable, easy cut-n-paste technique."
1n1mkj,"In addition to High Frontier, check out [Erosion]( where you try to uplift your mountain while wearing down the mountains of your opponents. It's a nice filler. American Megafauna is another Eklund game that you might find interesting. Like High Frontier, it's heavy, random, and very, very detailed. Bios: Megafauna is a (more refined?) reimplementation. Origins: How We Became Human is (yet another) Eklund game that might be interesting, although the science behind it is apparently a bit off. [[1](But yeah, if you don't mind heavy and random, High Frontier."
16pr42,"I don't understand why people are SO obsessed with other people's body/body image/weight etc. If you're happy being fat and guzzling bad foods, so be it. If you're happy lifting weights and counting calories, so be it. It's your life, and as long as you understand the consequences of your actions, then go to town!There's been some really wonderful, inspiring comments posted, and some really hateful, spiteful things said as well. I'm at a lost because both sides have very good points supporting their views :/"
8cxoeg,"Amen to that. Just continue to pray for them (if you’re religious), uplift them, and support them. Positive energy goes a long way!"
173spe,Great build-- I'm inspired to copy it!I'm surprised you didn't replace some of the cooling elements for a more efficient variety.
187us2,The man that inspired a space generation talking to them in space. Beautiful.
18id1i,"Its tasteless, I feel the same away about the Jeremy Scott native american tracksuits. Its one thing to be inspired by something and treat the source with respect. Its another thing to mock or exploit a culture."
90d0dw,Watch **About Time** or **The Secret Life of Walter Mitty**. Both are uplift movies that are enthralling stories.
164w6d,"Oh man, this is a cool idea - and it looks awesome. I really like your style too.I feel inspired to try this out myself, except I've never drawn people before. Any tips? (apart from read tuts online)"
8laxe8,David Brin's uplift series had some great aliens. Startide Rising was one of my favorites \(an earth ship full of uplifted dolphins being hunted by dozens of other races\).
18lhnt,You are an inspiration. I set my goals too high when I started and have taken a different approach: I bought game maker studio and am attending college for game dev. Takes a bit longer but you inspire me to be more proactive!
16yl4e,"I see me on a small house boat cruising Germany and Europe, living frugal, doing a mixture of programming, making music, djing and a variety of sports every day with different people to inspire and to be inspired from and have at least a small positive impact with everyone I interact with. Life is awesome."
16xtp6,"Capturing the art which nature creates and man builds. Inspiring with photography, words, and design."
8aho3j,"Benford's Galactic Center Saga changes humanity substantially.Brin's uplift doesn't change humans, just everything else :-)"
15stot,"I'd like to be an eclectic filmmaker; screenwriting, directing, props, special fx, music, producing. I'd like to make movies of all kinds like horror, comedy, drama, and any others.All in all, I'm just an artist in love with all forms of art. I want to be able to express it and inspire people. The whole point of making movies is to entertain and take people on an imaginary adventure, not to make money. I don't care if I'm hugely successful or not as long as I'm making someone somewhere smile."
6e1ed6,I like writing [poetry]( and [other writings]( to uplift people.
1840u7,Congratulations! You are truly an inspiring person. I wish you all the best good sir!
1880h3,I love this piece! I listen to this and the prelude in the morning when I want a bright uplifting piece to cheer up my day.
16kfi5,I believe this is a stylized image of an Iris in the the style of the [Arts &amp; Crafts movement]( Here is a [similar design]( on a tile. The movement was still going strong in the '20s so it is quite possible that a stone carver would have had some Arts &amp; Crafts inspired designs in his catalog of available designs.
166qdz,"This book actually inspired a science fair project I did as a kid. We tested different models of paper airplane, and different types of paper to see how these factors affected flight distance, air time, and accuracy. It was a pretty awesome experiment actually, and plenty of fun. Awesome book."
16ee39,"Mister Rogers would also be the first to tell you how little any of this matters compared to how important it is to love your kids. That man dedicated every second of his life to the welfare of children in general and it's totally inspiring. If everyone was raised by him, we would have very few problems with violence and emotional bottling."
16fgqn,I got Jethro Tull - Aqualung.And gave Big D And The Kid's Table - One Day (front page inspired)
18443o,You sir have inspired me to to play as much fiddlesticks as I can!

1zfgll,"Flood, Ark and Evolution by Stephen Baxter as well as the Uplift Stories by David Brin."
617ljp,"David brins uplift books. Humans are the only species in the galaxy that appear to have evolved by themselves, all others where uplifted to intelligence by a single original species. The first book is like a prelude and the second and third are based around a single event but happen on separate planets. The second trilogy takes place some time after the first and is probably more what your looking for. Aliens fleeing the oppression of the galactic empire hide out on an abandoned planet throwing away their advanced technology to live in secrecy."
16vdt2,"Well, for starters it is simply great entertainment. Secondly, I believe (just like OP) that it has helped my writing. The characters of SPN can be quite inspiring. And I'm not ""just"" talking about fan fics, but also about being inspirations for other characters etc."
1893o4,"Inspiring. Thanks for reminding me that I have to make that ""last time"" happen for myself."
1704ja,"Seems like it was a fun project to work on. If you have time, check out the films ""Music For Six Drummers and One Apartment"" and ""Sound of Noise"", if you haven't. They might inspire you for your next project!"
18m1a0,"Check out ""Yes Man"" with Jim Carrey. Yes, it's a movie, a funny one, but it may inspire you in some way too. I don't have many friends either, but one or two good ones is all it takes. Have you asked them for ideas? You don't drink? Have you tried it? Try it. Go to a pub. You may hate it, but maybe not. If you're mindlessly surfing the web (like right now), stop it, put your coat on and go for a walk. I always feel better after a walk, clears the mind, helps you see things differently."
4agicf,"Every time I watch a Bernie add a tear up. I'm inspired, I'm moved, but most of all I'm scared. I'm scared of what it will mean should we miss this chance to reclaim our country and uplift our people.Together, We Can Be that Nation.Please watch, please share. Please help us get there."
17xmff,"I grew up on the Star Trek: TOS movies, my dad watched Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home constantly. Star Trek:TNG was my Star Trek, I grew up with the show. Gene Rodenberry's vision of the future is so inspiring. Whereas these days in TV and Film, most visions of the future are doom and gloom, Star Trek stands out as an example of how the human race has the potential to evolve past our pettiness and really grow."
15s9lq,"I made an account to say I really liked this video! I've seen a couple like this before and I always really enjoy them, it's an interesting way to see how another person lives their life. Thanks for posting it.

17mrey,"This part of the poem "" ye weary wayfarer"" by Adam Lindsay Gordon is something I find pretty inspiring.

15ujyu,"Looking at the scale is very inspiring. Weight just seems to be melting off so far. All the things I used to love (fast food, soda) are so easy to turn down now."
18tehc,Tragic that they had to go so young - but I bet they'd love that they will go out being known for this amazing journey that they were doing. Their story will definitely inspire more people to travel like this and they would love that.

164ipb,A Dalì inspired piece could do well for logical vs. illogical. I made a melting clock my senior year of high school
15tbsm,I would try and read 'the immortal game' book and put some ideas from that book :This might help inspire YOUBe inspired and fly right in the face of adversity - treat it as a personal challenge.If you are truly inspired it should come out in your speech Btw on the subject of apparent nerdiness I am pleased that 'the big bang theory' has really caught on.Best wishesK

16ef4y,"I once wrote an essay about how I needed to come out and everything, but my teacher did not write something touching and inspiring.

15s7t5,"I just want to say, you've completely changed my views about hip-hop, turned me on to hip-hop, and inspired me in more ways than I know.

188ycq,"Room by Emma Donoghue. It was partially inspired by the story of Josef Fritzl's treatment of his daughter and their subsequent children, and written from the perspective of a young boy who has lived his entire life within a small room with his mother, and unaware of the world beyond that room. Really well written in my opinion because it doesn't deviate from a child's understanding of that situation, and doesn't use cheap shock tactics. It left me with a lot of ""what would you do?"" type questions and really stuck with me."
185xdl,"Hi, Dave! I am a huge fan of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters. I know you already have a million questions ahead for you, so I will just say that your song and video ""Learn to Fly"" is one of the best for me. Always makes me feel uplifted. Thank you for being so awesome!"

187rwr,"Reading your question actually inspired me to think of one on the spot:Unitarian Universalism -- or UU for short, because it is a mouthful! -- is a liberal religious community that emphasizes humanistic values and good works. Theologically, it's very come-as-you-are. We celebrate diversity and support each other in our personal quests for truth and meaning, regardless of theology or lack thereof."
16z75e," This is the post I had above yours in my feed. Related poem by Mary Frye Do not stand at my grave and weep,I am not there; I do not sleep.I am a thousand winds that blow,I am the diamond glints on snow,I am the sun on ripened grain,I am the gentle autumn rain.When you awaken in the morning’s hushI am the swift uplifting rushOf quiet birds in circling flight.I am the soft starlight at night.Do not stand at my grave and cry,I am not there; I did not die."

16zh90,"I can't speak for MLK, but the fact that these guys went from nothing to some of richest people in the country is pretty inspiring.

I look up to Wayne more than I look up to Trump."

86y1oo,"Old Man's War series by John Scalzi. Riverworld by Phillip Jose Farmer. Uplift Saga series by David Brin. The Postman by David Brin. Peace War by Vernor Vinge. A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge. Anubis Gate, which is more fantasy than Sci-fi but it is a great read from a great writer, Tim Power."
17xba9,"Not exactly, since a camera pics up light differently than your eye, but there are indeed places you can go to see uncountable stars and the band of the milky way arching across the sky. I'm guessing you live in a city, with lots of lights, and it's never *truly* dark. When you can, maybe go camping, or drive outside of the city for a good 2-3 hours. If you can get somewhere far, far away from the flood of lights in a city, a truly dark night sky is an absolutely awe inspiring sight."
18ypj2,"The second symbol over the first, absolutely. That said, have you considered instead getting a tattoo artist to create you a custom veterinary-inspired tattoo that is designed to be tattoo art, designed specifically for your body, and has more life as a piece of art? Since symbols like that aren't designed to be tattoos, they often just turn out so flat on the body, where you could have a unique custom piece that really enhances your body while capturing your feelings about your dad more vibrantly instead."
185o9y,"Good Will Hunting. It means a lot to me as a math major, personally. I'm not sure how to express it but knowing there are people out there who could out-think me mathematically that don't have the opportunity to study it academically really drives me.Also Black Swan. Nina strives so hard to be perfect. She stays after-hours, practices at home, and is always thinking about it. That drive to be perfect is really inspiring."
2n0533,"The Jophur are a fictional extraterrestrial race from Uplift Universe. Physically, they are a stack of waxy, living rings. Each ring serves a different purpose, and they connect to each other to form a single being by chemical means via an electrically conductive, sap-like substance that flows down the center to bind the stack together. They're like a stack of dribbly doughnuts that communicate with smells."
18r5ji,"I am truly inspired when I see someone, who is overweight, making a change for the better. When I see overweight runners I instantly become very proud of them and it makes me want to get out there and go running myself. Everyone who works out will get made fun of, at one point or another, by people who don't work out. As a woman, I get cat calls and honks almost every time I go running and it gets annoying and discouraging but you just have to put in some ear buds, tune them out, and keep going."
170v3f,"Wow you are beautiful, as someone who is just starting out I am both inspired and super jealous. If you hadn't posted in this subreddit I would never have guessed."
18b8bx,"The K2 is one of the most versatile mechs in the game, and the A1 is a blast. You'll want to eventually pick them up and use your C4 to help master them, so don't sell it even if you hate it, and you won't hate it once you experiment a bit and find a build that suits you.I've had mechs that I abandoned for a few weeks and was suddenly inspired to try a new build on that made them really fun to play."
170ssb,"So brilliant, so inspired, so informed, so breaking the mold, SO MAVERICK."
180wts,"&gt; Quite simply, I mean the ability to determine your own fate, the belief that human action is a choice and there are alternatives to our choices and actions.I find this incompatibilism quite curious. If you model a brain as a decision process, compatibilism and incompatibilism produce identical flowcharts, except incompatibilism introduces an additional random variable for non-determinism. So ""the ability to determine your own fate"" amounts to sampling a random variable. Hardly inspiring."
17genc,"What's so inspiring about these guys for me, is not that I want to do what they do but they make me want to get a job that I hopefully can find as fulfilling and enjoyable as they find all their jobs. Oh and be excellent at said dream job too."
18mpht,"There's not enough incentive or political fuel for nations to do so. Back during the Cold War, it was all about beating the Soviets. Now? Scientific pursuit may be noble and inspiring, but the common folk don't care for it. They need either a boogie man or a cause unlike any other. And good luck finding either of those today."
16ngj3,To add onto the already good list I recommend a coastal and fluvial geomorphology course. It ties together the natural processes of uplift erosion quite nicely and learning about surface substrate can give an insight into regional geology.
289773,"Cavemen are our ancestral history here on earth. And the times of Adam &amp; Eve mission on earth, were to uplift the culture of humankind, with their spiritual knowledge and superior genetics. But unfortunately for mankind on earth, Adam &amp; Eve committed error and defaulted their planned mission. And the consequences for the mistake is, the earth's people did not receive the full potential of their lasting uplifting heritage."
18lx6d,"A broader question might ask if you can be atheist and spiritual, to which I would say yes.That being said, my definition of spiritual is fairly broad and doesn't entail belief in a human spirit/soul, so much as an ability to be overcome with awe and a willingness to seek those awe inspiring moments and places. To me, sitting on an empty beach at night, or watching the dawn come in over a desert are spiritual experiences; they make me feel like a very small part of something much bigger."
16u34x,"I just want to say thank you to everyone on this entire page. I've had a real rough couple of months, and this was all incredibly inspiring. I'm so glad you've all made it, and so glad that we're all here to keep trying.Thank You."
5gk3b5,Dont feel bad about turning to personal development this is the greatest thing I've discovered since YouTube I've always been doing this kinda in my own way since a child but never knew there was a whole feild around it.working on yourself with a clear plan is better than some other nonsense I might otherwise have been filling my brain with at least if done right personal development can progress and uplift our lives.

15xmr7,You were already adorable to begin with and now you're beautiful! I'm totally inspired! :)
1799cf,"Hymns all the way. I am an Episcopalian, and we have a great tradition of hymns. I find hymns to be more reflective than modern praise music, which seems to just be very self focused and centered on hyping up the worshipper. The lyrics to hymns are much more imaginative and complex, and the sound of the music is just awe inspiring. I do like like Gospel, though, and I won't say no to a Gregorian chant."
168tvz,"Awesome photographer indeed, Zak's work is what has inspired me to buy a waterhousing and get out in the water."
4k0rd4,"Should come check out a meeting. AA is great because you get to listen to so many people and hear the world from there perspective. If you come to enough meetings and listen a lot it could really uplift your mood about life, you could also be inspiration to new comers as well as them being an inspiration to you. An AA meeting is one of the few places I can go and feel better after the meeting than I did before I went, not always but most the time. Just my opinions."
175rt1,IMHO I like checking /r/keto everyday and really like seeing the daily keto transformations. Really inspiring. I think it'd be kinda lame if we could only see these types of photos on only one designated day a week. Just my ¢2
18ofrj," Celtic (favorite group being ""Celtic Women""). The music evokes powerful emotions within me. Whether the emotions are uplifting or sorrowful, they touch me deeper than most music."
15u78d,"The art of writing fiction takes practice. Many people attempt it, but few can pull it off. What you need is a good imagination and a blatant disregard for the truth -- just like many of your ancestors had when they were desperate to deal with hostile lunatics and freaks. Let me say it in a way that is honest and inspiring;* ***Lie. You will be in good company.***"
15p4k2,"Trying my first ever run, and I do quite agree that it makes you value your pokemon a lot more. IT also is oddly creative as well, which inspired me to make a story as well about my character's journeys. I'm hoping to make my first post about it here in the next few days."
18qpy5,"Is there someone encouraging you from behind the camera or is the shouting part of the music? It's perfectly timed if it's encouragement. Also, great send, very inspiring"
176f67,You look absolutely gorgeous and you are an inspiration to those who choose to be inspired by your achievements! Thank you.
16pswt,"Thank you for this post, it inspired me anew! The quality of work I was doing wasn't impressing me enough, so I've kinda slowed a lot... But I shall try again, and set a goal to get a drawing at least once a week! Haha!!!"

18cqw8,"I personally believe a a good climber originates from that climbers mind set, i am impressed and inspired when i see a climber attempting a route hours on end, failing multiple times until they finally complete it. Makes me happy for complete strangers when i see someone complete a difficult route...only if i have seen them struggling before hand. :)"
8fe76y,"Wow some of these comments are ridiculous. This is someone in great distress. Uplift OP. Don’t present ifs and don’ts and don’t chastise him.

17qo3t,"Yes - my piano teacher, with whom I've been studying for the past 6 years. She really made me believe that I have musical talent and that I am a real musician, and inspired me to work hard to improve my playing. I would not be performing if it were not for her. She changed my life."
3px96a,The monk returns to uplift humanity....Got insights into your mindset and it is helpful...Thanks you for the posts...
16flw3,"Who, what , where, when, why, and how. You have created 'where', now try to put the same energy into 'who' and see if you characters inspire a story. If that fails, move on to 'what'. Even if they all fail for a given project, keep them for future stories, etc."
16na9e,"I was new to my school last year and only knowing a few people I joined clubs. I expanded out of my small clique and met people from all different sorts of cliques and grades and became great friends with them. Just remember that people put those signs up for ""join ____ club!"" because they want to meet new people, people they can inspire to lead that club later on."

18ts97,"Age means nothing, its just convenient to organize people.These feelings should inspire you to work hard to earn opportunities to experience other parts of the world and meet new people.

6h34p6,"I haven't read it, but David Brin's Uplift saga involves dolphins who have been ""uplifted""/been made sapient. I don't know how much of it (if any) is *set* in the ocean though.Madeline L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light is barely SF/F, but does involve a character with some ability to psychically connect with dolphins and takes place near the ocean. There's not much biology science, but a marine biological researcher is a major character."
18xo6u,"[Here's]( something that's probably a little different. It's a very soothing song, especially when you're trying to go to sleep. Plus it sounds awesome. I use to listen to this song to inspire me to do *something* never sure what when it started, but it somehow always worked.Edit: I meant to put the artist and name and everything and just forgot. I'm not fully awake. It's **Earth Drum-Thunder Dream by David and Steve Gordon.**"

6kl4li,All of us. Instead of waiting for some saviour we should all uplift our image together.
33wgmb,"David Brin's Uplift Trilogy. There aren't a lot of wholesale battles, just some skirmishes IIRC. It mostly focuses on intergalactic politics concerning uplifting lower species to spacefaring civilizations and humanities place in the universe because we don't know who uplifted us."
17uths,"If you want to get a 50's inspired styles, take a 50's approach. You do not need relaxants necessarily. You can blow dry your hair with round brushes to straighten it and then use big curlers for soft waves, or pin curls for more polished 50's look. There are plenty of youtube tutorials and supplies shouldn't be too expensive."
5wz8jy,"The Uplift series by David Brin is all about this. It's an early example too, with the first book published in 1980 and the most recent in 1998."
77mdj9,"I like MK10, that clean uplift and as soon as you start doing something you realise how twisted you are.Took a chunk of MK08 to Glasto and lost 6 days of my lifeI dont care what he sends when I order next week, 08,09 and 10 I found cleaner than almost anything else I've found on DNM recently"

5gt1an,"With Fanatic Spiritualist, you get -30% to Ethics Divergence, you could uplift those primitives and convert them to your ethos relatively quickly, especially if you build a Symbol Of Unity on their planet for another -10%. Also given the lack of colonizable planets to the left, try to grab any social research that increases your border range, I think there are a couple that give you 20%"
6u5l9b,"Lots of ways especially after Utopia. Just a few options:* Terraform the non-habitable planets* Make droids and colonise with them* Genetically modify your species to become more adaptive* Find primitive species with different planet type preference and add them to your empire or uplift the pre-primitives* Build habitats* Grab lots and lots of unity (you can switch to pacifist for extra boost)* Declare war on other empires and take their planets (and hopefully their pops have a different planet preference)* Get in a federationAnd definitely build frontier outposts, space resources are great."
16ay1e,"Showing your initial failures will do more to inspire others than you might realize. I also really liked the idea of getting your own stone carved, plus it not being a diamond.I went just 40 days from first date to proposal so something like this would never have been an option, but it's cool to see so many folks venturing into this kind of personal touch (and burns)."
3n6o74,The Uplift Saga by David Brin is excellent and fits your request to a T. The first book is the weakest imho and is really just a prelude to the other books. You can read a synopsis of it and not miss out on anything critical.
17ybl4,"I am very happy to see this. I went to a military college where such a thing would not have been possible, but I have hope for the future, and this is inspiring."
16v89h,I'm pretty much the same way with Chie Satonaka (Persona 4) and the third season version of Nanoha Takamachi (Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha). They're even inspiring on days where I feel a bit more masculine.

179xkp,"This photo is both dramatic and beautiful. Goes to show how 4000 footers can still be challenging and inspiring. I tried to hike the tourist route up Nevis in the summer but my blistered feet had just endured 160 KM of hiking and I turned around 1/4 of the way up. I realize this is the mountaineering sub-reddit and talking admitting to being defeated by a hike up a relatively small mountain probably puts me at the bottom of the crop. Oh well. Regardless, very cool!"
345jzm,David Brin's Uplift Saga has elements of this in how different alien races interact and entire races are expected to be subservient to others.
18shle,if you're looking for more contemporary takes on chinese inspired artwork I could recommend Ai Wei Wei (artistic name I beleive) he tries to offer respect for his culture while at the same time giving a sharp social commentary that has landed him in conflict with the government on occasions

17j4iq,Starting fining players for poor games. Start calling them out over practice or gameplay. Make sure your team talks are inspiring/motivating/relaxing as appropriate. Rotate in new players for ones on poor runs. Team talk. Offer contract extensions to low confidence players or players playing well. Change your formation and/or tweak tactics.
2hdk31,"Go to the gym in your lunch break. Absolutely the best productivity change I have made. It gives you a great break from a stressful morning, frees up time in the evening when you would normally go to the gym, and it gives your afternoon a huge uplift."
18a0ad,"When my wife &amp; I had free time, we would volunteer at[ PATH in West LA]( It's a program / housing complex for homeless people. But it's NOT what you think -- everybody who lives there have jobs and are getting help transitioning back into a self-sufficient lifestyle.

1yjcea,"I'll be in Vietnam again for this year's Fast. I'm expecting it'll be physically challenging, especially since we have a little one to take care of this year. It'll be a nice exercise in moderation, planning and knowing my limits along with the usual spiritual uplift. I feel as though this Fast will be an important and eventful one, too, since so many changes are happening in our lives now. With that in mind, I really want to focus on the spiritual Fast this year, and not just the material Fast-- making my inner life truly reflect Baha'u'llah's Teachings."

17hsml,"The Bible says so.The Devil has been the only friend humanity has ever had. He tried to free us from out servitude and accepts people for who they are, regardless of their faults.The ""loving"" God, on the other hand, demands absolute worship and that you do what He tells you to do without question.If the Devil really is evil and the Prince of Lies, I put forth that the Devil really inspired the Bible and the Devil we know is really the God the Devil claims to be.The old switcheroo."
197hg0,"This is a great early film from Roman Polanski if you like his other works (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby).It's a dark comedy involving two criminals demanding to hide out with a couple in their secluded castle.The style reminds me of late 50s Italian Neo-realism films like Fellini's (which Polanski was surely inspired by).This is a really good watch, interesting characters and interactions - it's a little slow at first, but if you can get over that hump you will be delighted."
197ji0,"I am sure you get this a lot, but you have inspired me into the world that is food. I am even in the process of going through your Les Halles cookbook.What would you recommend for an amateur home cook on increasing their skills beyond the idiom of ""practice practice practice""?And thank you for changing my life."

18rblj,"Dear Thom and Nigel,From where I come from, there is nothing much to get inspired about and music has been my greatest solace for the past 10-15 years. That being said, your music has had the most on my life. It is both life affirming and real and you guys do represent the zeitgeist of our times. How do you get the energy to make albums on a regular basis? Is the process as tiring as we imagine?Thank you."

16hpjm,"Trumpet/guitar - I'm a fairly serious Zen student, and part of my daily work is yoga. I feel that yoga helps the mind and body to act in closer coordination, therefore allowing the music to take less effort and be more easily inspired. I don't, however, think that it is necessary to be a good musician. I also don't think that there's much benefit to you if you don't believe it will help you."

You see how they work and are exposed to different ways you can do things, it opens up your mind to try new stuff.All the best!"
1682jt,"I do keto cause it works. I like progress pics because they inspire me. progress pics aren't going away. An extra click didn't end my world. And I'm not leaving the community that helped get me where I am, nearly 120lbs down, simply because I don't like a rule change. Life will go on, weight loss will continue, and in the end, this rule change will mean nothing to my actual life."
16em8l,"No, not really. If you want to pay someone a compliment to flatter them, there must be something positive about them you can identify if you think about it for a moment. But typically, I reserve compliments for when I'm inspired to give one."

16ybdw,"Whenever I'm alone and going somewhere, I tell myself stories. Not involving things I wish would happen, but very grim, graphic stories. They started with the third world war, then a sort of Dead Space inspired viral infection of alien origins, finally moving on to the aliens invading (without realizing their bio-weapon, which has worked countless times before, was fought off by the war-ravaged humans). It has a complex backstory that I'm quite proud of, and would be happy to detail."
185pke,"In general I would show them the videos of awesome player interactions.kidnapping, robberies, herbert-the-pervert-style direct-chat mocking, and stuff like that. Crazy axe-man, drugdealer in cherno.. all good videos to make people laugh and inspire their evil genius. Once they know a few things they want to do, nothing will stop them from buying the game.At least that's how I do it XD"
18fi64,"I can't help you with the French episodes, but this is really inspiring. It's great to taught yourself these new skills.I've been meaning to learn Spanish for a while.

3hojcr,"You might like David Brin's Uplift series. It's about humans' recent entrance to a huge Civilization of the Five Galaxies - in the books humanity is a backwards species, way behind in technology, and looked down on by most other race. But then we uplift some of our own planet's species - first dolphins, then chimpanzees. I recommend skipping the first (Sundiver) and starting with Startide Rising."
18198z,This is the most inspired photo she has from her uninspired performance.
16mehl,As a DM be as descriptive as possible it may inspire players to role-play off of things you never even considered significant. They can see things that were never really there and add depth to the story. Otherwise if the players are not-comfortable role-playing you wont be able to force them it needs to come naturally.

8c52as,"If uplift wasn't anything different than average or ""normal"" you have to be more of an agent in your own success. Approach men you like."
2u7gwm,"David Brins Uplift universe books. The premise is that for eons species throughout the galaxy are uplifted into sapience and mentored by an older species. The more species a civilization and its children civilizations uplifts the more prestigious that familial line is. Humans are rare in that we never had a parent species to uplift and mentor us. Humans are seen as an abandoned outcasted orphan by aliens, yet we have already uplifted monkeys and dolphins."
160ju4,"To go outwith ""official"" posters, there are some rather bright folks on redbubble, if you see an awesome anime inspired T-Shirt, the artist might have it or a PRINT of it on the site. Here's a search for anime in the POSTER section.You won't see anything official out of the 2087 results, but there are some really nice artist interpretations of lots of franchises, probably plenty of one's you wont really like, but theres the odd gem here and there and feel free to search the show of your choice.Have fun dude"
16tk97,Wow. That was... inspiring. See it's on a totally different level moving than having a fictional character paint so completely naturally with her feet.That woman is **awesome**!!
1upss8,"Because it's a marketing term. Despite the rhetoric, America does not actually have programs in place that uplift the poor in significant ways. By contrast, Scandinavian countries have excellent social service programs. Do some research and you'll see a wide difference."
5jo9ws,I honestly don't know what to say. I've been looking at this for the past 20min just trying to think of something that's more meaningful than the next. The sheer fact that I'm sitting here going through everything in my life that is good is awesome enough for me. Thanks for doing this man. I appreciate the uplift this time of year.
17asup,What instrument do you play? What symphonies do you play for? How difficult was it getting to this point? What's it like knowing you inspire many people with your talents?
6euf74,"As hard as it is follow this advice, don't knock yourself over this. It's just a number. Let your folks know about the difficulty of the math paper (share that article with them). Have a chat with your parents and actually let them know you are scared of the results. No parent likes to see their children sad/terrified . Good parents will try to uplift your mood and not focus on the results. Good luck."
1818nb,"Visit r/fitness and check out their sidebar. They are also a great community with a lot of supportive and encouraging people. Reading other people's stories is also very inspiring. But the bottom line is if you want to lose weight, you burn more calories than you consume, one way or the other. If that means eating less, cool. If that means eating the same as you do now, but boosting your activity level, then that's cool too. Good luck."
197ji0,"Chef I want to say you're an inspiration to me and that you turned my life around. I was in a rut, then I read KC and it inspired me to do something with my life and kind of activated my dormant inner cook. I'm now learning to cook and planning to go to J/W or CIA in a year and a half. Thank you so much for being the thing that turned my life around."

5gfqth,I'm hoping we find some pre-spaceflight species which we can either leave alone or uplift with all the consequences such uplifting could bring.

101u5v,"For me I've watched it since the very first episode. And I've been drawn by the allure of what they have sold as a utopian society reminiscent of my generation. Contrast that to some of the ridiculousness that that type of environment can inspire and it delves into a brand of humor that can enthrall me completely. Or something like that. Quite simply there as also so many idiosyncrasies that make it that much more entertaining to watch....i.e., ""you had to be there"" kind of joke."
16vuh5,"Personally, I think the Psalms are a good place to start. Easy to follow and very uplifting."
187msw,Doing slow fly-bys over playgrounds in a military jet.This is actually what inspired me to be a pilot. When I was little an A-10 warthog flew over the playground and it absolutely blew my mind. I'd like to show other kids what I thought was so cool.
3imont,The support here is amazing. So much kind individuals who want to help and uplift people.Happy RAOAnniversary!
194zxf,"I'm going to have to say the Wall is my absolute favorite album, I watched the movie at a young age and it has inspired me creatively forever. I've listened to it so many times, I know basically every nook and cranny, yet every time I listen to it, I notice something subtle I've never noticed before."
17t0p3,This subreddit also inspired me to stop biting so I could paint my nails like the pictures I see on here! Been bite free since August 2012! :)
17hrc3,Great post! It can be daunting task putting out your own comic. It's great to hear your personal experience. Your dedication to comics writing is impressive and inspiring.
17ok2p,"I inspired myself with hatred for those who always doubted me. I grep up hearing that I was nothing and would never accomplish anything. I kept telling myself, ""you are going to prove them wrong"". And I did. I don't talk to anyone from those days, I realize now that I don't need to. I made something of myself and they're still stuck in the rut that they were in years ago."

16n85r,"You are absolutely correct, what an inspiring simple explanation of the universe and physics."
18zjvd,"First off man, I really enjoy your videos. I think you are hilarious. My favorite moment was in your first post when that little girl walked by and you said ""my parents are dead!"" XDMy question to you is what inspired you to wear the cape and cowl and become the Caped Crusader of Toronto?"
17h08t,"Wonderful, heartwarming, inspiring! So happy for you and your daughter. Keep it up!"
18su7v,"&gt; IT was the perfect cast for an uplifting reality TV show: five orphaned siblings and the loving family friends who took them in.Would make sense if ""reality"" and ""uplifting"" weren't mutually exclusive."

17bhdx,"Salvia to write about the afterlife, skydiving to write about adrenaline junkies, a month studying music theory to drill some ideas into my head about a world of music, open-ocean swimming to write about fear (open ocean used to scare the bejesus out of me), and a trip to Tanzania to see wild animals in their native habitat.I love 'method writing'. Rounds me out as a character.More often than not, though, I find myself going on adventures and being inspired to write afterwards--as opposed to choosing a story and going on a specific adventure for 'research'."
15s5zp,You're melting! Congrats on all of your hard work. Stories like this inspire me to keep going.
17d4wb,"Do something to help or enrich the lives of others. Could be volunteering at a youth/vulnerable peoples centre, getting involved in a local art project, or making a set of instructional videos on youtube about something you know a lot about. If you inspire just a single person you're still making the world that little bit better."
7w4v1z,"I am not able to join the festivities today but there have been some really nice people stopping into my store. I am happy to hear that everyone out enjoying the parade are being responsible and genuinely embracing the spirit of the day. I am wearing a green shirt with dogs on it to show my support. It's been a beautiful uplift for the city. So proud of our team! I rode a trolley to work today and while we were squeezed like sardines, everyone was polite and nice."
17x8kg,"Not to be depressing, but if I died now, I don't think there were would be a memory I'd want to show. I'm only eighteen years old, and none of my experiences have been that defining or awe-inspiring. This sounds super corny, but I'd want there to be some message about seeing the good in everyone, and how every single person is beautiful in their own way. I'd want them to love each other, at first maybe through my name, but eventually just because it's right.Edit: Spelling."
8ebg1n,"Always David Brin's Uplift Saga. It features hyperspace lanes and a rich, galaxy spanning society. The different species are roughly feudal in nature. Your ""lord"" is the species that uplifted you. Having uplifted species raises your stock in the galactic civilization.Humans are found, apparently sentient from natural evolution and not uplift. They have uplifted chimps and are on the way to uplift dolphins, so they have a strong galactic position. The saga tells the story of this universe."
16ae4p,"Heaven is going to be one part, a lot like life is today minus bad stuff, and another part sitting before the throne of God and worshiping. Now I get that the latter part might sound boring or whatever, but just imagine being at a party with all your friends and some really awesome people, and an awesome (literally awe inspiring) being right before your eyes. And worship can be dancing, singing, kneeling and a whole slew of other things. So half party, and have living on the new earth."
6wo9k3,"I was thinking about the difference between the Left and the Right. The right wants power and hegemony for white people, The left wants to uplift every minority group except for Asian men, but they will never uplift them above themselves."

7uftx1,"Its more cyberpunk than 90% of what's posted in this sub.To me, cyberpunk shows, at its core, that people are lousy, even if we are presented with technology and science to uplift ourselves. Cyberpunk characters aren't good people. Case from Neuromancer is a drug addicted hacker who killed three people before the novel started. Judge Dredd is a violent facist. Deckard is an alcoholic burnout. And Black Mirror main theme is that technology doesn't help people be better, it helps us be worse. Technology, though, isn't bad. People are."
186f7w,"Salaam,I have a suggestion about that - and I agree with you about the state of everything.Would you consider forming a pact with me to post one inspirational thing to islamic subreddits every day? Youtube video, image, quote, whatever format, just as long as it is inspirational and doesn't spark debate. There is too much debate but not enough inspiration! Let us inspire people to worship Allah and do good things. :) what do you say bro/sis? Edit:Invitation to not so secret pact is hereby extended to everyone else as well!"
3m9nqj,"AMA and I will answer exclusively through quotes from Kwame Nkrumah. EDIT: For those not in the loop, Kwame Nkrumah was the leader of Ghana from 1957-1966, Ghana being the first decolonized country in Africa. Nkrumah focused on trying to free Ghana from the neo-colonial economic trap where the country would be legally independent but economically dependent on foreign capital, and although he was partially successful with a lot of social programs designed to uplift the status of women, expand education, etc., but ultimately his goals failed and he was overthrown in a coup d'etat."

1dzxdo,"Fi to me has always been ""Cartoon Hero Logic"". Your own beliefs come before another's, your own convictions and beliefs matter most. They are strong and deep. TBH, John Lennon's Imagine is what comes to mind first.Fe is essentially the horde. Everyone should just get along! It hurts when someone just doesn't feel the same way you do, or their sour mood is bringing you down. Strong Fe can uplift the people around them, and influence the ambient mood.

5klc87,"Plates are always in motion. Even if it doesn't seem like much. Some plates are subducting under other plates, which can cause uplift or volcanism away from the plate edge boundary. As for Wales, the Atlantic ocean closed (north America hitting Europe and Africa), then opened, then closed again, and opened again. Those collisions and movements are likely what caused your mountains to form."

3w3pqk,Have you read the Uplift series by David Brin? It's excellent and the development of animals into sapient beings is a large part of the story. Particularly cool is that Brin provides perspectives from the uplifted Chimps and Dolphins.
185xdl,"A few questions:What got you into music?What was the first song you remember playing? Or the first song that really inspired you?A lot of people let fame get to their head.

17pt4g,"As someone who is a supporter of rescues and a dog lover, I cringe at these photos. Your photography is top notch, but I find that I'm more motivated when rescue groups focus on the dogs they've saved.

17s7wt,"I opened it and thought, meh. I started playing, and paying attention to the music, the dialogue. It captured me. It pulled the right emotional strings just enough to make you attached but not enough that you realized you were being manipulated. I'm glad I played this game, it was fun and soul-filling. And thank goodness you didn't made the twist-ending, I think it works better as a feel-good game. You've inspired me, I might even take up the One Game a Month challenge."

5pqsa1,"Antelope Canyon is on the Colorado Plateau, which was uplifted by the Laramide Orogeny, a convergent event which formed the Rockies. Erosion that formed the canyons followed the uplift. Erosion doesn't necessarily ""smooth out"" ruggedness of a landscape, in fact it usually increases it, as rivers cut down through tectonic or depositional surfaces to leave ridges and canyons. But yeah, you could definitely say something like Antelope Canyon formed as a result of convergent tectonics."

Dean White and Jordie Bellaire are not only doing awe-inspiring great work, they are beginning to get their due on what they contribute to the creative process.I hope the attention they are bringing to the craft inspires others to either a) take up the craft, b) take chances with their coloring to create something unique, or c) take into considering these unique approaches when hiring colorists."
16u5vk,All Scripture is inspired by God. What ever Paul wrote was inspired by God. If you look at the old testament the male is always the authority. Eve came from Adam.

17r4id,"Not tryin to be a hater, but man, I can't believe this made the front page. This dawkins quote has been recycled in so many different inspiring-quote memes, it's starting to be as overplayed as those faux-inspirational photo memes. It's becoming a parody of itself. Find another quote, guys. Dawkins has said plenty of inspiring, thought provoking ideas."
18hi61,"This is very inspiring! Congratulations! Also, I think you're cute. :)"
163uxn,"I hear you. I really do. One thing I notice consistently is that friends who continuously seek my ear during difficult times aren't very good and meeting me when I'm feeling the need for an ear in return. It's as though it shatters their perception of me as ""good listener/advice giver"" when I reach out for some in return.When I experience a particularly dark time, I'm always inspired when I remember what an absurd opportunity consciousness is. To be born into this beautiful dark world we live in, well, it's the chance of a lifetime."
176n4k,Inspiring play from him today...just amazing! I hope he wins over more fans from his great play today.
1933yb,Congratulations!!! It's great that you're sharing this story to help inspire others. We all need to know that this is doable because it's so different from what people tell us is healthy. I also wish I'd been as forward-thinking as you at that age. Great job!
17qayv,"Ditto Birdman. Gentle approach maybe, but you inspire a strong finish ; o)"
16duj6,"Hello Mr. Whitacre,I am a music teacher in Saskatchewan, Canada and I was wondering... With all the choir workshops you do with students across the world what is the biggest thing overall, that choir students or the choir as a whole should work on on to become a better vocalist/choir?P.S. As with everyone else on this thread, thank you so much for what you do. You help to inspire our students and get them excited about music which makes our job that much more enjoyable!"
164ys7,"Until I saw [this video]( I had no idea half a million people were evacuated via boat after the attack.The Coast Guard made a radio call:Any available boat wanting to help with the evacuation of Manhattan report to Govenor's Island.""Hundreds of tugboats, ferries, private, pleasure, essentially anything that floated was volunteered by their captains to get people off the island of Manhattan.It's 12 minutes, but pretty awe-inspiring."
18qegz,"[The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry]( I'd heard that it was good before I read it, but I was completely unprepared for how wonderful it was. There is a lot of questioning and soul-searching, but it's very uplifting and powerful in a rather quiet way. If you just want to laugh, [Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal ]( is a lot of fun. And do try [A Prayer for Owen Meany]( It's absurd, funny, incredibly sad at times, but it's been my go-to book for decades when I need something to get me out of the dumps."
18bhme,My questions are1. what is the thing in your life that you attribute your success to. (If you can say something/someone that inspired you greatly) and 2. What is the secret to stay at the top once you have made it there?
18bhme,"Hello sir, you are one of my heroes from modern day. You, your accomplishments and your charity work are truly inspiring.My question to you is, despite all your success, what is one thing in your life that you would have done differently if you could?Thanks again for doing this AMA."

38igww,"There was a story in one of the Gardner Dozois' collections a few years ago in which all the creatures on Earth suddenly undergo a major upward shift in intelligence. Some interstellar field was suppressing neural activity, and when the Earth drifts out of the field, all creatures on earth ""uplift"" simultaneously. Cows start forming organized efforts to escape their pens, wild animals start behaving very differently, the higher primates are suddenly gifted with human-level intelligence.Darn, can't remember the name or author though."

It makes me angry because I'm not there yet and you're beyond where I'd like to be without training and I'm struggling, but it inspires me because now I know that it is actually possible to get there! So thanks!|[Deleted] Didn't realize you were on a band"
16bq23,Thank you. This is really inspiring. I got about 2/3 of the way to my goal and stopped. I can stop making excuses now.

16kouy,good tactic. Have to try that one. I look up to you 2 weeks in. Wish i was as strong as you. Still would love to get past the 5 day goal. IM sick of being &amp;*($. 30 something and acting like a teenager locked in his room. you inspire me man

16yhom,"Jake, you've inspired me more in these 20 minutes of reading about you than anyone has in the past few years. That smile during uncertainty is truly inspirational. Makes you realize how petty the things you complain about really are. To his family- you are beautiful human beings who should be commended for being supportive when he needed it. That smile I'm looking at wasn't because of Reddit's money. It was because he had you by his side to his very last day. Rest in Peace sir."
173uun,"I'm still a teenager living with my parents, but /r/minimalism is actually inspiring to me, and when I eventually move out, I'm going to keep myself from buying too many things, and get an easy, early start to minimalism. I've had the good fortune of realizing years ago that people just don't need *near* as much crap as they have. I think the reason for this mindset is visiting my grandparents often. My grandmother is a semi-mild hoarder, who has over a few decades probably wasted away over a million dollars of my grandfather's money on absolutely useless, unnecessary stuff."
18z74p,"Fighting depression I was essentially giving up. I was skipping lectures to stay in my flat and do nothing, drinking myself stupid and neglecting the basics such as personal hygeine, eating right and sleeping well. It felt as if I were on borrowed time. In time I don't know how but I found this spark...one that inspired this refusal to give in. since then I aimed to fight this, got on top of studies and to the gym etc"
18pik4,"Hi Cmdr Hadfield, your pictures are inspiring thousands around the world to become interested in space. Would you consider releasing a book of your pictures when you return...

18g4hm,"Well, if you're looking to do the whole ""thanks for inspiring me"" bit, then you should just do it. Make a post saying what you want to say, and if we can upvote it enough, someone should be able to track that post down.Not sure where that kind of post would go though..."
3y2mzx,"This is just me, but I'm mindful now of who I am with. If I'm pissed, did I just encounter an angry, difficult or irritable person? If the answer is yes, I got to do some cleansing. A hot bath, meditation or just talking it out with a calm and understanding person can help clear any difficult emotions. I find that some people can uplift, while others can make you feel worse. It's all about what energy we are picking up on.If I'm alone-music, writing, dancing or exercising helps. Anything that's fun helps."

3kcdq6,"The [Uplift]( books by David Brin discusses this, in the context of the stories. The books are well worth a read."
18u4n1,"Try Oliver Sacks' *Hallucinations* - I'm just about done with it, and it's as fascinating as his other books. It examines the neurological underpinnings of various types of hallucinatory experiences and gives very vivid accounts from patients. If you're interested in pop neurology in general, Sacks' earlier books are also excellent - *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat* and *An Anthropologist On Mars* are well worth reading. Mind-reading - piffle. The way the brain *really* works is a thousand times more awe-inspiring than any Madame Blavatsky mumbo-jumbo you can find."
93csbp,"I was here in Jan. It’s a scary place to be. Take a breath and know you’re not alone. If the themes and ideas in the BOM resonate with you, then you don’t have to throw them out. Fiction can inspire and uplift. But if you want to keep a literal/historical view, that may be hard. The “new-Apologists” now call it an inspired plagiarism, pretty much."

4wg9um,"If you haven't already done so then read the [Uplift series]( by David Brin, it has some truly alien aliens.If you want something lighter then read [Schlock Mercenary]( His aliens are different enough to be more than just Trek's humans in latex masks, interesting in their own right, but not so alien that they can't interact meaningfully in a party type setup. As an added bonus it is soon to be a roleplaying game."

I have not found anything online saying whether the concept was inspired by Frank Herbert's Dune saga."
17nyzf,"this was really inspiring and a great read as an independent dev who's first game sold ~300 copies on iOS even though it was loved by people that played it. Had to resort to contract work in order to stay independent.I really like the idea of prototyping out 10 or so ideas and seeing what works instead of just sticking to ""the next game"" that you have planned out. Just getting out of the global game jam I'm realizing this. Keep up the good fight fellow indie dev, your games look great"
197287,Disclaimer: I'm a friend of the photographer. Right before his first trip in December he showed us the bullet proof vest he bought to keep him safe. Needless to say it was a bizar sight for an average Dutch Joe like me. The courage of this guy is inspiring to say the least.

1839nc,"Unlike the Bible or the Torah (and I don't know any other religious scripture, sorry), which are explicitly written by humans (some might say those humans were inspired by god, but the humans still wrote it), the Koran is believed to be written by god him/her/itself. The book itself is a divine symbol, whereas the Bible is just a book that contains words and sentences that are valuable. Burning books in general is evil anyway, so it doesn't matter."

If I don't feel like focusing, I set short word sprints for myself in between developing some more ideas and fleshing out my world-building. Also I've found some great support in posting in the hashtag #amwriting in Twitter.

If they know its important to you then they may be inspired by you!"
1ybs1n,"I have experienced no uplift from workouts lately, but I know that it has to do with the fact that I'm working hours that are severely impacting my health. I also found before this that workouts without cardio don't help to boost mood nearly as much as cardio on its own. If you want to boost you chances of the endorphin high, I'd say try and boost the amount of healthy lifestyle choices you make everywhere else and make sure to make room for long, constant blasts of cardiovascular workouts in your exercise routine. This may help."

72kpru,Let me recommend the 'Lost Regiment' series by William Forstchen.It's another long series (7 books?). It involves a US Civil War regiment transported to another planet where the native humans live at a medieval level of technology. The regiment helps uplift them to rebel against their alien overlords.
2ikx4z,"Well, there's an argument out there that basically says if you want to solve problems of poverty, education, etc., then it's most effective to uplift women. The reason is that they are still the ones who do most of the child-rearing, and mothers tend to suffer the most when things like crushing poverty, ignorance, war, etc. are rampant. So, in that context, I agree.However, my personal importance doesn't have squat to do with my reproductive ability. I make my own importance (or lack thereof)."

3xp97l,"Tectonic forces uplift rock that was once on the bottom of the ocean. The rocks are often made solely from the shells of small invertebrates, called limestone. It's not that the shells were found at the top of mountains, its that mountains are often comprised entirely out of shelly rock. Based on the sequences of the different types of shells we have a pretty good timeline to compare the ages of different rocks. So we can go to a mountain, look for shells in the rock, and match the shells with their place in the timescale."

16ghux,"I was a game design intern for Riot over the summer of 2011, and it was honestly the coolest thing I had yet done in my life. It was my first foray into the game industry, and it made me absolutely certain that game design was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life--it was so inspiring to be surrounded by some of the most driven, enthusiastic, and talented people I'd ever met. Anybody who thinks they have what it takes, DO IT."

You helped inspire me to return to the kitchen/restaurant biz after years of unsatisfying work in offices, etc. I can't imagine ever doing anything else now.

Humanity is at times mindboggling negligent, maliciously stupid, and collectively incompetent. However, for all of that non-sensical bitter experience that comes with being human there is also a lot of love, a lot of happiness. There is an abundance of awe inspiring things in you existence that make your life living. You do not see them now because they are obscured - but you will see them someday."

4fwuvc,"In my campaign world, one holy order dedicated to Dionysus is known as the *Blushing Fools*. When they are not actually drunk, they pretend to be so, aiming to be underestimated by others. They uplift allies with silly pranks and bitingly candid satire. They specialize at misdirection in battle. They are chaotic neutral, and their teachings hold that personal responsibility is a vice. Yet they can be effective and entertaining companions, so long as their allies maintain a sense of humor along the way."

These conversations have been enlightening and have challenged me to dig deeper for myself. I see content on other subs that challenge me negatively but I can always pop over here for an uplifting article/self-post or respectful conversation. Thank all of you and God bless.

I tell them that if i somehow made it big, it would be mostly inspired by my musical influences, which i stole and are very numerous. If i bought all of that i wouldn't have money to buy drums in the first place. And i would care that someone cares about the actual music, not the money"
908rbg,"A couple of novels I can think of:Tchaikovsky's *Children of Time* includes a meet-up between two different millennia of human space-faring civilizations... sort of. A post-apocalypse / revival generation ship arrives at a terraforming/uplift project from the previous cycle of humans in space. (Bonus: stand-alone novel!)In Rusch's *Diving into the Wreck* (series), human expansion through the galaxy collapsed, leaving relics of the older but more advanced tech behind (mostly wrecked space ship)."

The context being if you were alive 5000 years ago, and thus have the morality of society at that time.Of course if a text was divinely inspired, its message should be timeless and not only make sense if you have the morality of a barbarian. Now if a text is not divinely inspired, then yes you would expect it to reflect the time it was written in :)"

On a mission to uplift and empower.I'd be in the schools but outside the school system, giving me much more flexibility with how I interact with the kids.

We enjoyed the uplift, then naturally become more receptive to ""a little bit more"".Statistically, imagery -- still pictures and video -- makes up the bulk of people's storage and Internet traffic.

What I can tell you though is that I feel very inspired by your effort and if anything you should keep going and try practising with anyone who'll help you. Most people does not care that you can't speak very well because they're excited to help you learn."
16glcm,"So few photographs can capture the feeling of glancing up and down a New York street, conveying the magnificence and awe-inspiring wonder of this great city... screw haters man, I feel like I'm there when I look at this."
17zywx,I just love seeing all the cool things like this people build. It's really inspired me to make my own videos.
15w5vh,"Dont try to force them into sports/music/art (like my mum did), instead, try to ***inspire*** them. My dad used to teach me highschool/uni physics and chem, in simple terms of course, but the same concepts when i was about 8-12 years old, and it really instilled a curious nature in me and my brother, which really helped us develop interests in the world, and in critical thinking.Basically, I'm grateful for the times my parents inspired me and let me do things, not made me do things. so just try to make things interesting and fun."
17edro,"Things I learned from this post:1. Be skinny2. Wear jeans and a simple top3. Don't be not skinnyITT: People defending thinly veiled thinspiration posts like this, and people who see it for what it is and are blindly being told by people who *don't get it* that ""this is inspiring for any body type!"" No. Miranda Kerr looks good in these pictures because she is a model, not because she is wearing particularly exceptional clothing."
17tjzy,This team looks...different. Inspired. 3rd place is just around the corner!
17tlb1,It's a very inspiring era. I hope we can all learn from them and finish what they started.

16e8jx,Buy a G. Smoke it. Get really imaginative. Create the next amazing kids show. Inspire millions of kids. All for 20 dollars.
5whn0f,"If you have not read Brin's Uplift novels, you may want to check them out.Humans are the new kids on the galactic block and have the audacity to send out science ships instead of just accepting all of the ancient records as good enough. Then a ship crewed by uplifted dolphins finds something unexpected."
18l1ue,"Computers and the things that you can do on them have huge potential to engage kids in stuff that matters. Learning how to program is just one of several skills they could learn in a fun way and it's not necessarily the most important one either.For example, a game like Kerbal Space Program could inspire a kid to learn about engineering and aero/astronautics. If done right, it should be possible to already teach some fundamental skills this way, or at least make the theory seem less boring."
16gp36,"Heart breaking news. I followed her blog avidly, kind of hoping for some sort of miracle post expressing her joy and disbelief that she somehow beat it.She changed, inspired and saved many lives with her campaign to sign people up as bone marrow donors. For that. This girl will always be a hero. R.I.P"
8n45ok,"What volunteer work do you do? Not to be pessimistic but I've worked with a lot of ""volunteers"" before and a great majority of them are just there for selfish reasons (for their CV, or just to feel like they ""save"" these ""savages"") and are not actually doing anything to uplift the area they're ""volunteering"" in a more than ""look at those smiles"" kind of way. Like how people volunteer to build schools in African countries where labor isn't really what they need."
5uyzi2,"Similarly to an above post, I am open to a new team winning the World Cup. As long as it represents an uplift in their ability, and that of lower-ranked nations as a whole.In return, I would take a single 40m sidestepping Dane Coles try against a full strength, no-excuses Lions backline. I'd also like to point it that this is a different question to previous ones, and was directed at a different group of people than the ones answering with such authority."

17gnju,"Fun fact, Frost was also originally a theme intended for this land (its old name was Flow). There's something about that land and inspiring awesome music I guess?"
15x0fl,I was just talking to my wife about how amazing it would have been to be around Lennon while he was writing this song from a creative burst inspired by a street poster. I think it was his ability to make great things from his observations of the mundane that inspires me the most. He was a creative genius.

2emxl7,"I can't really imagine how it is to be in your shoes but are you doing other things beside nofap to improve your condition? I mean... you have to replace the fapping with something. Stuff like going for a walk, meeting up with friends, playing some sports, reading a book might be things that can uplift your spirit. It's not enough to shut yourself up in your room and think hard about how you'd like to fap."
179fee,They say that being brave is being scared and performing anyhow. I don't believe men like Mr. Armstrong fit that definition. The shear magnitude of of what he has done under the conditions that he did them is beyond inspiring. Take that fate. Take that world. I've got things to do and I'm going to do them. We lost a giant last year.
18og2p,I used to watch my father do pushups like that. One of the most inspiring things the man ever did.Now helps me focus on gaining that level of grip. Got a very long way to go ...
176f67,something about a lady who can inspire me to go fight a bear. seriously. Amazing Job!
4buuxo,I'll accept that. I'll going to do my best to uplift whatever tribe it is I get dumped on and try to make sure that what I know doesn't cross the Channel until it's too late i.e. we have steam-powered tanks that can take on more than ten warriors at a time.

8lyu6g,"I'll second Hyperion and Nights Dawn. I'll also add the Uplift series by David Brin. Humanity has uplifted chimps and dolphins to sentience, and discover that that's the basis for intergalactic society."
186qzq,I'm laying next to my boyfriend right now and he's wearing that same shirt! This post has inspired me to pull out his sword and go on an adventure.
8f6yeu,David Brin's Uplift series has a galactic civilization that has spanned at least a billion years. The age of the civilization becomes more and more apparent as you get further into the books.
17vvwn,"you guys are amazing and it totally shows through in this video. we're positive you'll inspire so many others in the us and around the world to work hard, save up, and make a career break a priority."
185xdl,What song that you've written means the most to you?And if you have time:Where do you picture music going in the next decade? What inspires your lyrics and what tips might you have in regards to lyric writing and matching the feel of a song? Are you self taught on drums and guitar? Thank you for doing what you do and for continuing to inspire me and so many others to push creative boundaries and keep music real. Rock on.
7isd5e,"I think he's talking about the ultimate heat death of the universe. Unless the physics-defying powers of the Light and the Darkness can reduce entropy faster than it increases, ultimately everything will gutter out and cease. No life for the Light to uplift, no conflict for the Darkness to encourage, no energy or information for the Vex to use. In the face of the fact that all of everyone's efforts is meaningless and will ultimately come to nothing, Calus has decided that his own particular brand of nihilism will be to make [every day a revel]("
197ji0,I love you because you've inspired me to not just travel but to actually try to understandy the places you are in and take life as the locals do. I just got back from a 6 month study abroad in Barcelona and it was one of the best times of my life.I hate you because I ate Andouillette in Lyon.
59zfvo,"They don't like anyone or anything that they deem to be ""better"" than them or outside their abilities. Their natural instinct is not to uplift and encourage someone else to achieve more than them, but to subdue and compete against them."
1aq6sa,"Absolutely. Everyone seems to have the opinion that overhead should be 10% because Waste Waste Waste and it cripples so much. The point should be to build capacity and create a significant apparatus of uplift, not keep the needy needy.People will spend $400 on a phone but demand to see the books and organizational chart before donating $10 to a cause they believe in, and god help the cause if they don't illustrate slave labor as a work value."
7ztkkc,Congratulations on making the change! It’s great that you are showing benefits already. I had a mood uplift when I switched and I know others who had it help their anxiety.

3dtoqu,"John Scalzi's Old Man's War series is a fun read. The Postman by David Brin is an excellent post apocalyptic scifi novel (don't judge it by the movie). Also, David Brin's Uplift series is pretty good, too."
170a00,Slam Dunk inspired me to pick up a basketball. It was pretty neat being able to compete against Sakuragi in terms of rate of improvement when I was a kid. Needless to say it was impossible to win but the way I had to push myself was intense and very fun.
16vdpm,"Keep doing what you' re doing! You did great by sticking to your commitment in a challenging environment. Maybe after a while, your family will do better at supporting you. Maybe you' ll even inspire them!"
8u7qtv,"David Brin's Uplift series is about an intergalactic civilization started by a long-gone alien race, in which sentience is bestowed to other aliens via genetic engineering to create space-faring familial clans. The novels revolve around the political fallout (WAR!) of the discovery of a fleet of ancient ships by the sentients of Earth..."
6jqj0e,"Yes, but just that itself isn't enough and can lead to a rather shallow society. We use self-interest to create value so as to provide products and services to uplift everyone to a better state. That's basic economics and a more ""perfect"" society."
16mq0g,"Mr. Schwarzenegger,I know how busy a man you are, but you truly are a huge positive influence to me. I have been lifting for about a year now, while on a high protein/low carb diet. I'm weighing in around 180lbs, but am struggling to tone up my arms. I've tried higher reps with lighter weight, and still, I'm not seeing those very defined his/tris. Is there any simple advice you could give me to help me accomplish this feet? Keep inspiring people, good sir. You're a great man!All the best,Dan"
33651v,The Uplift books by David Brin involves lots of aliens and uplifted apes.
3kmgd4,"If you matched, say something to him. Otherwise, it's just a neat little uplift for the day when you realize a guy you like is into guys too. Whether or not you end up giving him those smoochies, you can still take heart that the universe unfolded in one small way that you had hoped."
16rrob,you are not alone-Michael Jackson or will you be there is always uplifting
17vkjf,"I didn't get into making comics until high school and they were crazy incredibly personal pieces at the time and I didn't realize that till later on after I'd thrown most of them way. Still, it was a good way to cut my teeth. They were all about a demon named Carl who had ""wacky"" adventures inspired by whatever was on my mind when I made them at 2 in the morning. I had something like 1600 pages before I started to study art and stopped drawing."
185xdl,How much has Rush influenced you? and thank you for being so inspiring.
17u28r," I say ""spargel"" pretty often and as for music... I got nothing. Something of my own maybe? Happy and uplifting I would say."
16m6qv,"This is really, really inspiring. I can't wait to get to this point. I'm so glad you've found happiness again and that you're seeing the good more than the bad. Congratulations, friend."
15s1uf,"Oh my science. Inspired work that has inspired me. I must go build a castle now. Awesome work, Wafflecopter."
15vkj4,Yay :) I've been playing minecraft for ages but am still too nervous to play with strangers. You may have just inspired me to give it a go!
16nxmy,"OP, I made this post: to hopefully encourage and inspire you about your futures SO that'll eventually come your way."
515utm,David Brin's uplift novels have a lot of politics in and between really alien cultures.
15y9j7,"My advice, as my prayer life is abysmal is to read: read GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, Tolkien, and of course the lives of the saints. There are also plenty of movie which I always find inspiring. Molokai, The Mission, and Au Revoir, Les Enfants are just a few of my favorite movies which portray the spirit of the faith well."
1901f7,"Any Disney film is uplifting to me but also, some cute upbeat films we may watch are: ""13 Going on 30"", ""You've Got Mail"", or ""27 Dresses"". (You'll be singing ""Benny and the Jets"" loudly by the end of that film, and forgetting why you were bummed.) On the other hand, my son may say ""Happy Sandler"" ; ""Stepbrothers"" or ""Major Payne""."
1v0uyr,"Frank Herbert's Dune series is fantastic! You could also take a look at David Brin's Uplift series, fantastic read. I second the Known Space series by Larry Niven. His book Integral Trees was the first sci fi book I read as a teenager, and really kindled my interest in the genre."
3tityo,Absolutely. It's a part of growing up. It took me a long time to get over the guilt and obligation I thought I had to those people.It's 100% okay to feel this way. Surround yourself with people who uplift you and make you want to be better.
334cm6,"I sure hope so. If we can uplift a chimpanzee to our level, it bodes well for the theory that we can uplift ourselves to some higher level of intelligence."
4cteb2,"When I'm feeling existential or bummed out and smoke I feel loads better. It's not a total uplift by any means, but it definitely helps me."
16fqrw,"*Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates* by Tom Robbins was a very inspiring read. I didn't take anything from it other than that it was a good book. It's very slow in the beginning but once you get into it, you can't put it down."
18i6s3,I think black holes are pretty awe inspiring. It would be cool to test them from around their event horizons.
18fdgv,"The humanized photos of Joseph Stallion were inspiring. Thank you for sharing, Comrade."
15zsz5,"My 1st attempt at a quality emblem, inspired by the Aeon Flux eye: [Eye]("
16ya81,"That's a hell of a transformation! I've more or less the same body structure and the same height, so it's quite an inspiration to see what a difference 15lb can make. I'm at your starting weight right now, so seeing your post is really inspiring. Thanks and good luck with exercising, I read that you're about to start more cardio. Way to go!"
192xmb,"I was into origami well before I played the game, but in Persona 4 you can fold cranes for a job. That inspired me to get a kit for a thousand and make my own. I'm almost done with them, but I think I might have to get more since it's a kind of zen experience for me and I don't want to stop. I might have to start giving them away, which is what you're meant to do with them anyway."
17wgfz,I see someone was inspired by my origami insanity.Now try the scorpion! (muahahahahaha)

170hc5,"With the culture of convenience spreading all around the world, it's inspiring that some people are going back to their roots and learning the basics.When I was young (born and grew up in the Philippines) my grandma made all my clothes, even my school uniforms. Such was still common back in the 80s. Today, I know only the basics of sewing, both by hand and by a sewing machine, but thank goodness for the internet, I can teach myself."
8abl08,"This applies to both slavery and plutocracy. The first thing is to eliminate slavery, and ""punishment"" for the slaveowners, if anything, should be limited to reparations for what was gained through human abuse, suffering, and exploitation.The same with plutocracy. The first thing is to establish wealth caps. And then to restore and uplift the rest of humanity, which has been and is being ruthlessly robbed, exploited, and abused by the system of unlimited property rights for the few and artificial scarcity and retardation for everyone else./r/Autodivestment"
1sq6l1,this gives me hope for my hearing soon!...thanks for the uplift!!
3a8nq0,"The second trilogy of the Uplift Saga by David Brin has one of the best alien protagonists I have ever encountered. Jophur is very alien, yet very relatable. Iceworld by Hal Clement is about half from the perspective of a non-carbon-based lifeform."
163enp,"I know how you feel. For awhile, I felt that I could only cosplay black characters. But after discovering [Cosplaying While Black]( I was inspired. Seriously. Check that website out and see black men and women of all shapes and sizes cosplaying whoever the hell they want. And doing it well! There area couple of black Yuna's on there too! :)I'm currently working on two costumes. Marceline the Vampire Queen and a Pikmin. :) I'll post pictures when they're finished! I'll be debuting them at PaxEast this year!"
17rof5,"The first three seasons are really inspired, I wouldn't necessarily claim they are my favorite as many other seasons/series are better executed and have more to offer, but Verity Lambert and the initial production team seemed to subscribe to the go big or go home philosophy more than any production team since. Sometimes the consequences were questionable, but you don't see the same kind of epic scale world building and complex problems that exist without the Doctor with that frequency with any other production team. I was amazed when I watched them."
1hv66m,David Brin's Uplift Saga is great.So is Gregory Benford's The Galactic Center series.Get them both on Audiobooks if you can. Awesome in that format.
19ohq9,"I usually go out and treat myself to a nice guilt free meal. It's nice to have a ""normal"" day. It's depressing having diabetes so sometimes you need to do something nice to uplift you. It doesn't need to be food related, but thats what does it for me."
197ji0,"I know this will probably get buried but I want to say it anyway. Thank you. You are the person that inspired me to cook, and travel the world. I'm 17 years old and I'm now working in a kitchen, and I've gone on 3 trips to countries, to try the food and learn as many different cooking styles as possible. You are the inspiration that drove me to do everything I do in my life right now, and in the future.Again, Thank You."
18bhme,"As a graduate student studying and working in the field of humanitarian aid (I examine moral distress experienced by expats who volunteer abroad), I just wanted to say thank you for your amazingly generous contributions to your fellow humans. Your non-profit work has been outstanding, innovative, and transparent. I truly hope that one day I can work for an organization as inspiring as yours. You and Melinda both are incredible people and you are doing an incredible job. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
2pdip3,"Keep working up to longer distances. In my own experience once I adapted to 90 minute runs, after going that long I'll experience an emotional uplift that lasts several days."
16bgfu,"I'm currently reading Cosmos by Carl Sagan. It's a little bit old, but as far as I can tell, most of the information in it is still accurate and it's beautifully written. It's also fascinating to see his ideas of the future and how it compares to present day.Even if you're not big on science, I'd give it a shot. It is by far the most well written and inspiring science book I've read."
2fn80l,"David Brin's got a few. ""Earth"" -- we create our own disaster, then solve it epicly. On a galactic note, his ""Uplift"" books are pretty darn good (and the source of the Uplift trope often seen in this subreddit.)"

18r0bb,"On the contrary: I've learned I resent whatever I have waking me up, so I never choose songs I love.However, my friend used to wake up to ""[Go the Distance]( from Hercules, which is kind of a funny yet inspiring choice."
17outt,"&gt;So I've decided that I want a tattoo, but I haven't found so much inspiration yet.Then wait. You'll get inspired by something eventually. Maybe buy some magazines or check out some websites to help inspire you."
8p3id5,It’s all about making yourself look good because people often treat people horribly or mediocre when they’re alive so they were uplift their dead memory
75080y,"these affirmations might be helpful:I am open to finding a loving partnerI accept and appreciate the good in my partnerI am a positive and loving, supportive person. I help uplift my partner."
5yt2ly,I came to communism initially because of seeing the elite of society consistently manipulating and exploiting our population for nothing more than increasing the bottom line. I believe if you have the only means with which to uplift the quality of life for the impoverished then you have a responsibility to do so. This obviously will not happen and thus it is up to the people to look to a different system.
177fzp,"Having met Jónsi at Iðnó in 2009, whilst collecting the field recordings that make up each of the 11 songs (for, about and inspired by Iceland) of my new record on Lo Recordings, I wonder would he would consider writing a simple two line poem/saying/thought in Icelandic to enter on the inside cover of the artwork? Sin Fang, Amiina, Seabear, Benni Hemm Hemm and múm have all contributed, but you guys altered the way I think about music.No worries if not, thank you for your music and inspiration nonetheless.Al(Zoon van snooK)al@zoonvansnook.co.uk"

16yoff,"Personally, I can't do something that I don't want so just look to get inspired somehow or do something that means something to you. Basically, do what you like, not what others like, if you and the others like the same thing? Thats a win win."
7aa3aj,"Do at least 1 small kind thing for another each day; it will bring you joy and uplift you. Don’t be afraid to seek professional help if you need to address things with an objective party or get medication. Avoid substance abuse.Most importantly, be kind to yourself. You are young and handsome- and you’re going to feel happy again."
918sfa,"I like Brin's Uplift Universe. If you are going to go space opera, go all out! Similarly, the Sector General aliens."

1p4mmf,"If we have a strong foundation in Paul's grace-alone salvation, James becomes clearer when we understand that it's written to those who are already believers. It's a book of wisdom, not a book of doctrine. It's for our edification and to uplift us, not to put us back under the Law."

8sos5p,"There is no action plan, such a dream comes only to make you afraid.

It made me happier than anything else in the last few dark months of my life, and it always brings me hope. I hope you get the same joy and uplifting feeling from it that I did. Enjoy!Also if you like the clip above, here is a drawing I made that was inspired by it (the background was added by me via gimp):"
17m2x2,"The books have cool pictures and flavour text. They can be a great source of inspiration. They are also a little easier to navigate in my opinion, however they are also a lot slower to find what you are looking for.SRD is just text. It's not going to inspire you, but it will offer quickly accessible information to someone who already has a decent understanding of the game.Monster Manuals are always great because there are numerous illustrations and flavour text that you wont find in the SRD."
18p0ln," Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there; I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow, I am the diamond glints on snow, I am the sun on ripened grain, I am the gentle autumn rain.

Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there; I did not die."
162c25,"awesome.This reminds me of a book I read..""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"". It was inspired by these sort of photographs. It is a fantasy book, but the pictures used throughout are real."
18cjl9,"You have made one of the few videos that keep on inspiring and driving me to keep studying chemistry. Even if it gets to the point where I almost quit, I watch a video like this and it makes me work ten times harder. So with all of me, I say thank you."
16mq0g,Arnold. I just wanted to say that as a boy seeing alot of your movies inspired me and I would say it has shaped me in little pieces of who I am.I must say thank you.
7j13jf,"Where's your fitness at now?Polarized training (a la Seiler) is likely going to be your best bet: absolutely crush it on as much Z1/Z2 volume as is reasonable for your life and current fitness, with one ride a week where you put yourself deep in the red to get an uplift on vo2max and FTP."
4apee1,"Well Sagittarius has quite a bit of skyward thinking in it's mythos. I had been looking into it last night and found a few things on it.

17feeh,Amazing - appreciate the detail steps it took to make this finished product. As a fellow modeler/animator a lot of things often get lost in translation in tutorials or steps aren't clear for beginners not used to the programs people use.I am glad you posted this workflow because it will hopefully inspire those who have great ideas to perhaps pick up a new skill and add to a community they've love.

He travels to foreign lands, meets strange and inspiring people, learns new languages, including the language of the universe, travels across expansive deserts and falls in love. He uncovers a great treasure, but along the way discovers that perhaps the greatest treasure of all is already within all of us."
18ppzq,I plan to build a Stonehenge-inspired seating ring around a firepit in the backyard someday. Someday.
97cb04,So you mean to tell me a generation of young men rather listen to someone uplift them and tell them how to improve themselves to make their world better over being preached at about how they are oppressors and responsible for women's suffering

18ykc9,"I've been having a lot of fun telling my roommate about something cool I did and then watching him get inspired and crash a bunch. Encouragement laughter is a thing, right?"
18xbl7,I think you might have inspired me.Yep... I can definitely feel inspiration coming on. :D Very lovely piece. I really love the imagery -- especially with the porcupine quill. It has a very strong impact. :D
7ezhow,"Girls Write Now, if you care about arts education. Mentoring program for high school girls who come from underserved neighborhoods, mostly girls of color and low income, where they meet weekly with professional female writers. Also help with college prep and 100% go to college. I have a personal connection, but am also personally interested in educational programs that help uplift students in NYC (similar ones include Breakthrough New York, Girls Who Code)."
8o0pek,It's a celebration of what people have fought for and an uplift to those who still struggle with homophobia and brutal laws every day.
4tjvic,The Uplift series by David Brin features some alien species that are at least nonbelligerent.*Dragon's Egg* by Robert L. Forward is about a species called the cheela that are living on the surface of a neutron star. It's a pretty cute and touching story about helping each other. Pretty hard science-fiction.

18bhme,"The progress you and Warren Buffett have made for public health is truely inspiring. I am particularly interested in your family planning work. What advice would you give to someone like me, who has a solid public health education without billions of dollars in resources, to have the greatest positive impact on the world?Thank you so much for everything you do and for taking the time to do this AMA."

188ghv,"We cannot tell you how to feel about your transaction. If you feel more inspired with your new equipment than with what you traded it away for, then that's all that really matters."
7hcjba,"I think while your statement is true for the most part, not all rich people are inherently bad or gaming the system. So many doors wouldn't have opened for me without the support and in some cases financial support of wealthy people. If I ever make it to the 1% I'll be there to support a path for poor people. I already want to uplift people such as high school friends to better themselves financially."

16ig1k,"Congrats! It's an accomplishment! 23 pounds is fantastic. Not just that, but you've gotten past the mental goal of that Mighty 200 AND you have picked up again after a break, which is probably the most exciting part of it all! You could have given up, but you didn't.I'm down about 9 pounds since Thanksgiving, and sometimes it's discouraging to see all these ""look, I've lost 40 pounds in two months"" posts... for some of us, slow and steady does win the race :) Thanks for being inspiring :)"
6t8814,"Vernor Vinge's *Rainbows End* presents a fairly positive future.For a light book, try Terry Pratchett's *Strata* and anything by Harry Harrison about the Stainless Steel Rat.And David Brin and Kim Stanley Robinson both write quite positively about the future, even if there are threats to be overcome. Try *Antarctica*, *Escape from Kathmandu*, *Earth* and any of the *Uplift* books."
18bk9x,"I ordered the Coastal Scents 88 palette because I've been inspired by people like you posting colorful looks :) I usually like neutral eye makeup and bold lips, so I figured a palette that isn't expensive and has a lot of different colors would be a good place to start!"
17kd2n,It isn't easy napping this much. It takes careful planning and sleepiness beyond any mere human. It is kind of inspiring.
7oiiur,"One of the best for this, even though it gets a little weird, is the Uplift series by David Brin. Six books, featuring space-going dolphin-astronauts, fanatically religious spider-bug-alien things, a planet settled by genetically modified chimpanzees which is taken over and occupied by fascist military bird-aliens, and aliens made of a stack of rings that each individually have a personality and link up to become one bigger personality, kind of like a pile of quite clever starfish. It's great for aliens."
26bjre,"Go out and do something. Whether it's alone or with some friends. It just helps to do something and have an adventure out of it than sit and think about your ex. Plus, you never know where you may end up or who you're gonna meet while you're out. Could be a new friend or someone you're actually into. Also, don't be afraid to blast some music and dance and sing around the house. Forcing yourself to have fun is the best thing you can do to uplift your spirit."
17gfih,This turned out great! I've been pulling my hair out trying to find a glider I love that doesn't cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars. You've inspired me :)
6y5ogj,I have been in the same place. I know it can be difficult when people around you put you down. Those aren't friends though. Find people who uplift you. Sometimes just being with yourself isn't a bad thing.
17fi08,"that's a hard question because i do not know what ailments you are facing, My take on Siddhartha's teachings was that the dharma was like a medicine, you have to know what sickness you have and ask "" what you are striving for"". that is why there are three vehicles, Hinayana-Mahayana, Vajrayana. one is not better than the other, it depends on your disposition and what your hangups in life are. The dharma can be uplifting if the sickness is properly remedied or an anchor that brings you to the lowest pits of karmic consequences."
174szd,"That is awesome! I wish I had an inspiring moment from the show, but the extent of which of it has changed my life is that I push f5 a lot monday/thursday and probably freak out my neighbours with my amount of squeeing."

18k16m,"I love the graphic novel. The depth of the world and the characters is both incredibly inspiring and something to be admired. I sympathized the most with the comedian, even though most people seemed to have written him off as a destructive cynic. I really like your theory. I have thought that about Rorschach myself, but I think it's that way for all the characters. No matter how you feel about any of the Watchmen, as the reader you are still capable of empathy for each of them."

7ukbeo,"After a few years of legalization and products begin to come out like they have in legal states, like little odourless puffers that come with names like “sleep”, “calm”, “uplift” and they gently vibrate after you’ve had your dose, people who never used thc/CBD before will convert as there is the stigma of cannabis is gone (the plant, the smell, smoking).

16frt7,Just want to say that I'm appreciating all the uncharacteristically nice/sweet/uplifting/helpful comments. Tragedy pulls people together and most of us know when it's time to just say stop and get real but sometimes Reddit is just a 24/7 hatefest with only a few subreddits that keep it together. Good luck out there in 2013 everyone and let's keep it going in some meaningful way. TL:DR I appreciate that Reddit is playing nice today.
16k5p7,This panorama shot is spectacular! You've inspired me to attempt this myself.
174spf,"This is absolutely lovely. The emotions that can be inspired by simply watching relationships grow are incredible. The indian man who offers him different food each time is incredible. Initially, he is skeptical, but he warms up to the man with the camera. People are so cool."
1x7tec,"C. J. Cherryh's ""Foreigner"" series might be of interest to you. It deals with a colony of humans who end up stranded on the world of the Atevi. These aliens seem relatable, but they have significant cultural differences that lead to severe misunderstandings.David Brin's ""Uplift"" series also has a lot of alien races that have been involved for vast amounts of time in creating new sentient species through the process of uplift. Humans are an oddity, a intelligent species that seems to have developed on its own. Lots of interaction with many clans of species."
18qhym,Congrats on the bonus! My favorite song at the moment is Sworn in Metal Wind by Lost Horizon. It's the most uplifting song ever. I've never listened to it and remained in a bad mood.
167ssa,"*""Everyone should have the heart to save a team mate, I couldn't do it there.. I would never leave a team mate behind.""* So good, the respect they have for they're team mates and peers is inspiring, awesome video, as a long time TF player: thanks so much for the translation!"
18pik4,"Colonel Hadfield, first and foremost, thank you so much for taking the time to perform this AMA, and letting Reddit be a part of this historic event. While many of us have expressed our views of astronauts as some of our modern day heroes, my question to you is this: Who is your hero, and what inspired you to embark on the path that lead you to where you are today? (which is sitting in one of the most desirable chairs in the solar system)"
45d4z9,"To start with, Charles Sheffield. That guy knew how to write big stuff with great characters. Start with ""Cold as Ice"", then just buy everything else he's done. Somebody else said Peter Hamilton. Yes. He's currently the parallel of the ""bigness"" that the ""Culture"" universe entails. Not the same, but broad like that. An old-school recommendation is Clifford Simak. Early explorer in a lot of core science fiction concepts. Benford did the ""Great Sky River"" series. Very huge. Brin's ""Uplift Universe"". Starts with *Sundiver*. David Weber, ""Empire from the Ashes"" series."

18skqs,"There isn't any way to die that doesn't inspire fear. Whether by lethal injection or eaten by dogs. Death is a scary thing. So is prison. Prison is an awful, terrifying and unforgiving thing. No one there will show you any kindness. So would I rather spend my last days in a scary and awful place and die afraid at the end or spend 4 times that amount of time happy and carefree living a life of comfort before dying afraid at the end?[](/shiningarmor)Don't second guess yourself. You did the right thing."
160jxl,"I don't comment often but you're doing such an amazing job I feel like I'm being forced to join in. Amazing work buddy, hope you keep it up. Absolutely inspiring."
1by0xl,"It's fair to say that erosion and uplift of mountains are at equilibrium worldwide. Some mountains are rising, and other are eroding, but they mostly even each other out. The driving force of plate tectonics is the radioactive decay of isotopes in the mantle. The driving force of erosion is the sun, which evaporates water to make rain and moves the water with wind. So, until there is either no more sun, no more water, or no more radioactive isotopes, we're likely to be in a similar state for a while."
17qeer,"I highly recommend the youtube series ""Excavating the empty tomb"" It basically lays out the case that the first story of Jesus was written not as recollection, but as a piece of fiction. Incredibly fascinating stuff for someone like me who grew up believing this stuff was divinely inspired and that only heathens would ever find errors in the bible."
3xkkn3,"Try the 'Uplift Trilogy' by David Brin ('[Sundiver]( '[Startide Rising]( '[The Uplift War]( Interstellar politics in which humans and dolphins and chimpanzees are new arrivals in a galaxy-wide civilisation involving many old and varied alien races. Or [the Galactic Milieu Series]( by Julian May. This series is both a sequel *and* a prequel to her Saga of the Pliocene Exiles (gotta love time-travel!), but it works as a stand-alone series as well. Again, there's a lot of interspecies galactic politics, leading up to a Metaphysical Rebellion. (Although, the series does focus mostly on a particular human family.)"
17vvwn,"That's an inspiring video. You make a dream many people have seem very possible. My only question is how do plan something like this? Are there agencies that specialize in this sort of thing?Also, there is some major hate going on in this thread. Keep doing you, bro."
16srub,"Geez I was looking forward to seeing some nice uplifting lines. All these seem so depressing..""I lean against the windPretend that I am weightlessAnd in this moment I am happy"" - Wish you were here, Incubus"
16av15,"Neal Stephenson's ""Snow Crash"" kind of predicted modern MMO's with its ""metaverse."" The book also introduced memetics (which, in turn, inspired modern viral marketing) to a broader pop-sci audience. So the next time Christian Mingle ads pop up on Facebook, say a little prayer to Mr. Stephenson."
4bvvyl,"David Brin's Uplift Saga covers pretty much all of that. The first book is is worst book ever (also his first book) but its's more of a prequel than part of the series, so if it doesn't grab you, just skip it and read the synopsis."
177fzp,"First of all, you guys are AWESOME. Now on to the question, are some of your songs inspired by individual events, or is it just random awesomeness?"
184o8m,"I'm going to an adult soda party tonight! The theme is ""Big"" sodas, inspired by a recent trip to the Dr. Pepper museum in Waco, TX. We've got Big Pineapple, Big Red, Big Peach, Big Blue and Big Red Vanilla Float. We're going to use them to craft colorful, alcoholic beverages that are going to make us feel like crap tomorrow!"
15ypv5,"I think that is amazing! I think it is much better to look at body fat percentage than actual weight. After all, you may be building muscle as well! That is wonderful! 5% is hard to lose! I was like 180 lbs. with 33% body fat and 150 lbs. with 27%. So it is a lot of work to lose percentages, but it is worth it! I think it is wonderful that you are becoming a healthier you and inspiring others on your way!"
18dgve,You totally just inspired me to go extra hard tonight when I work out. Thank you!
16mq0g,"Dear Arnold,Thank you for inspiring several generations to become greater people. What are the driving forces in your life right now?

18stjk,Great post! And another consequence- you may just inspire someone else to get through another day sober.
4w5vle,"This would actually be really fascinating in multiplayer, starting at different ends of the galaxy and deciding whether to exploit or uplift the AI around you to take out the other player."
1769hi,"That's really sweet--I like how you made video footage interesting and digestible. Now that my son is older we take so much less video, and I'm sad about that.... but I sometimes also think about all that footage just sitting unwatched from baby and toddlerhood, so it's hard to get inspired to just add to the pile. ""Music videos"" like this seem promising! Heck I might even be able to get my son interested in making them himself!Also I bought the song from your soundtrack. LOL"
18m3j0,"My heart goes out to you, dude/dudette. Last summer I donated a kidney to my little brother and it was an intense experience. His health was starting to decline (at age 21, to boot) and being able to help him was easily the most satisfying experience I've ever had. The fact that you're keeping your chin up despite the situation is incredibly inspiring, and I wish you all the best. Not ""internet"" wish you the best, for real wish you the best."
17rd6o,"Thank you guys for inspiring me to program in the hopes of helping even a few people. I am still not very old, but when I was little I would think wow these are some amazing guys.

Thank you guys for being the most inspirational people in my life, and giving me a reason to program. I love you guys."
16mq0g,"Arnold, I've watched many movies with you in them, including Pumping Iron.I must say the movie has inspired me to lift twice as hard and fix up my diet.Hell, I'm even trying to do more cardio just to get cut.My question is how did you achieve your muscle gains (excluding steroids)?How many times should I lift in a week and how many hours?My diet is pretty good, low card - high protien."
17vx8l,"I know that feel. I used to video edit... make AMVs, ect. I did this for years, and it's since become a little stale. I don't really know what to do to get that spark back, but I know what helps a little bit. For me, watching well edited AMVs always gets me in the mood to edit, because I feel inspired. You could try seeking out some really good Fanfics and honestly just read. Read until something sparks a creative light in you. Good luck!"
16vb23,"I like to point out that any answer involving a god or magic or whatever hoodoo is the result of an unquestioning mind (because the answer is already known in all cases). Intellectual laziness can't really be fought other than by inspiring a need to continually question and discover. So, shame him, basically.Fortunately, a strictly watchmaker view of a god puts him on pretty much the same page as atheist scientists, i.e., a god created this infinitely fascinating and explorable world for us that we can learn definite things about and have control over."
18h6ws,This is a video song I made to thank Tosin Abasi and his crew for being incredibly inspiring musicians. Everything about what they do means so much to me as a musician and inspired me to write this. Hope someone out there enjoys it.

16grfi,"&gt; Does not a white bird,Feel within her heart forlorn?The blue of the sky.The blue of the sea.Neither stains her; between them she floats.A lone white bird, drifting between the sky and the sea.Doesn't this poem remind anyone of Misuzu from Air?

4f5mty,"Terranigma really would be great. The action-RPG gameplay could easily be modernized to give the gameplay an uplift, and as you stated, the story/music are still a gem 20 years later. The ending was one of the first times I was truly moved by a story. I don't think I cried, but my throat got a little tight/sore."
188z23,"I ran a mile without stopping to walk for the first time in 2 years. Also, *lost* weight for the first time since coming to college.I feel so incredibly inspired. It's like going to the gym every day is now really, tangibly paying off. :)"

18bhme,You are an amazing person and you inspire me to be helpful in any way I can. That is all.
1vm7vr,"To be quite honest, I don't do it for the 'funkybod'. I do it for the spiritual uplift. The feeling of success and self-improvement. The way I feel when I step into my sanctuary. Sculpting of the body is just a favourable by-product. May Brodin stay close to our hearts and keep us from falling astray."
5zk26o,"It's a feature of David Brin's Uplift novels, since the central premise of the setting is that civilization is very, very old, and almost all sentient races were genetically uplifted by others, older races who've been uplifted by even older races, in an unending cycle of uplift and expansion and extinction where habitable worlds abandoned by extinct races are carefully shepherded as a resource for new races as yet unborn. Not really what I'd call the main focus of the series though."
16mq0g,"Arnold, you are a personal inspiration to me. I grew up watching your movies which inspired me to take up lifting and better myself. Thank you!"
16bqfa,It's good to hear that a social media site can be inspiring and life-changing. Who needs expensive weight loss plans when you have reddit? Congratulations.
187iwo,I just watched tpb afk and i was inspired by the way you've stood up for your freedom and our freedom. whenever people ask what torrent sites to hit up i always say tpb cause they will fight for you. maybe im wrong but thats the impression i get. loyalty goes a long way.
1729k8,"Okay, I believe ""Thank You Too"", is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Do you remember what inspired that song? When you sit down to write a song like that, does it all just come out at once, or do you ""move things around"", from day to day?Finally, if you do just sit down and pump something like that out, how long did it take?"
182js9,This is fantastic! Now my author sims can go to inspiring locales and write their novels! Thank you!
176ne1,"I think the only thing that could stop the fandom now is some global catastrophe. We've already usurped the show itself as the primary content generator. We are a meme unto ourselves. The show could be canceled tomorrow, but the explosion of popular energy would continue. I think the artwork, stories and music of fans alone will inspire artists, activists and ethicists for the rest of their lives."
5je3sg,"I think you'd love David Brin's Uplift Universe books. It comprises two series, The Uplift Saga, and the Uplift Storm Trilogy the main theme of which is intelligent races genetically engineering other races into sentience. For Earth, that means intelligent Chimpanzees and Dolphins. The first book, Sundiver, is probably the weakest being basically a murder mystery, but creates the setting of the Uplift Universe. From the second book, Startide Rising on, the stakes rise immensely with an intergalactic war that puts the existence of the Earth on the line, and eventually the order of galactic society itself."
48xeop,"My husband and I are going to figure out how much he donated (he is the expat) in February *the banner month for Bernie) and tomorrow, after the results are in we are going to match that amount.

If you get inspired by anything, you tell them. If something is bothering you, talk about it. If you just have a dumb idea, make it a topic over dinner.Talking is the easy part. Time will only tell whether you lose interest in them or they in you."
16tx36,"they are the definition of motivational music. so perfectly written, even when it's brutal it's still uplifting and gets you going. JB is the man.it's a shame they won't catch much attention on here since they don't have clean lyrics. dudes are an inspiration."

6yw7pg,David Brin's Uplift series is similar small humans in a big mysterious galaxy to Raynolds with a more space opera/action science feel.
181dvb,"This one, since I don't really use it for ""thought-provoking, discussion inspiring"" purposes, but rather to crack wise and vent."
16ef4d,Mr. Brightside - The Killers. Even though the lyrics certainly aren't uplifting they always seem to pump me up.
3yp6o9,"*A Fire Upon the Deep* and its pre sequel *A Deepness in the Sky* by Vernor Vinge. Each book covers a different alien species being contacted by Humanity and switches POV from the humans to the aliens. Humans hold a significant technological edge in both books. The *Uplift Universe* series of books by David Brin to a lesser extent as well. Humans are admitted to a larger galactic community after they are observed ""uplifting"" Chimps and then Dolphins to full sentience. You get the POV of several other Alien races as they encounter humanity."
8m8yuu," The Life Engineering mod does that, albeit it doesn't require Biological Ascension. It allows you to create a pre\-sapient/sapient species on any habitable planet, and to uplift them to Stone, Bronze, or Iron Age, all done through projects."
18rr34,"I became overweight through eating nothing but junk, and having a sedentary lifestyles. Poor choices and abusing my body. I was inspired to lose it when one day I couldn't fit into many of my old clothes. I started working out and eating right and managed to lose 25kg in just under a year. I am still hoping to lose more but I'm just happy to maintain at the moment."
1824gq,"Thanks for sharing - you look great! And I'm glad you posted this because I don't have a significant amount of weight to lose either so I feel like its going to be harder. You are inspiring me to keep ketoing on, as I am only a week a half in"

172ny7,Hi! Huge fan! As a fellow musician I find that your music is very inspiring.1. How long does it take to write a PTH album?2. How much do you guys practice?3. When you are going to write a new song what is the process that you guys take to do so? Do you piece together a bunch of Luke's riffs and add more to them?
18laa6,This is pretty awesome! You just inspired me to start building houses again. I haven't done that in quite a while.

15x701,"LethalFrag is definitely the biggest fish in the BoI ocean - very organized, interactive, and with nearly all the negativity of online anonymity removed. I'd recommend following his channel for some great chill casts, and as a bonus, he speaks highly of other inspiring or aspiring casters in conversations at times that you can check out.He's not playing BoI as often as he used to, since he's waiting on the remake before diving back in, but there's plenty of great games (lots of indie ones, too) to see."

He'd be proud."

53uqbe,"That would be neat, but it's also sort of already in the game!When you uplift a species you can edit their genome, including changing their preferred planet type. If I recall correctly, uplifted species always have 100% habitability for their homeworld even if it's different from their preferred planet type."

How would we feel if intelligent life in our Galaxy was relatively young, and that we are currently the most advanced, and that all other life we find is of the equivalent intelligence to a great ape .

177khq,no knock on Dave Ramsey but I wouldn't listen to any financial advisor he recommends. he is a great motivator and great at inspiring people to get their personal finances together but he gives very bad investment advice. start here instead: take your time and learn about investing yourself. it might seem daunting at first but it really isn't that complicated to understand the basics and make some good sound decisions for yourself.

1pn002,"So far I came up with:* Why do geese fly in a :""V"" formation?As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an uplift for the bird immediately following. By flying in ""V"" formation, the whole flock adds at least 71 percent greater flying range than if each bird flew on its own* How many dogs make up an Iditarod Sled?16 dogs* Who was the lead vocalist for Guns N' Roses?Axl Rose* The Marine Corp Motto is ""Semper Fidelis"" What does that mean in Latin?

8rugf3,"Different sediments erode at different rates or get deposited differently depending on many factors like shape and size of the grain, to the forces like water and wind that move it. Bedrock can shield erosion of layers below, and with geologic uplift and subsidence a cliff for example could be an uplifted section that had resisted erosion, or a lake made by water pooling into a subsiding depression."

16g877,"Having been all over Europe, I can safely say Auschwitz has been the single most moving experience of travels. It is awe inspiring in the most disgusting way possible. It is very sobering to realize that as you walk around the camp, you are walking on more than just dirt. You tread on the ashes of hundreds of thousands of people. It is the most chilling experience I can remember,"

But great job man. Keep it up!"
16dsbo,"Hokay so, here's the ~~earth, eez round~~ deal. First off, take plenty of pictures of epic creations. Secondly, make NERD creations - small market, but you seem like you'll fit in just fine.

Would love some updates!"

Martin and Dimitri Moraitis, ""The cherubs are the babies of the angelic world!… The cherubs are the first cycle in the spiritual development of angels. They appear about two feet tall and look a lot like a human baby, but their head is not as disproportionately large as with human infants… They uplift humanity by there very presence…"" pg. 84"

18bani,"I loved this. My favorite paragraph:&gt;In short, if you want to meditate, there is virtually no excuse not to. But human confusion is very clever, so it is still possible to talk yourself out of it. If so, be my guest. Sometimes that’s the way to finally begin serious meditation practice: by not doing it for ten or twenty years, until finally there is no choice.Inspired me to end my meditation ""break"", right now."
15wfia,"I use the major Arcanum symbols to inspire a lot of my art. The pillars of the High Priestess, the four evangelists ( ox, lion, eagle, and man) of the Wheel of Fortune, and the Magician's wand also featured on the World card, all come to mind"

17sg62,"Well, no one knows for a fact exactly what happens after we die until we're on the other side, so the belief is the faith that the Scriptures were right and divinely inspired truth. Many nonbelievers want things to be proved with solid evidence and unless you account for near death experiences, there is little that proves it per se. I once put it as there are those who believe things unless proven wrong and there are those who don't believe things unless proven right. Usually non believers lean to the latter."

17r67e,"I've nurtured every sensation Man has been inspired to have. I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him. Why? Because I never rejected him. In spite of all his imperfections, I'm a fan of man! I'm a humanist. Maybe the last humanist."
5eueoo,"The funny part about this is that modern Democrats will probably take it less as ""convince blacks they're lower than you and it's the white man's burden to uplift and mold them"" and more ""convince whites they're better than blacks and they'll be more willing to pay taxes because of white nationalism""."

167sgh,"To finish a game is already hard enough, it's far too easy to abandon projects especially when doing something on the side, and many many people have failed to finish up projects for lack of discipline, enthusiasm or determination (I know I have).To have the tenacity to stick with it and finish it in 3 years is very impressive! The end product actually looks pretty polished, and extra kudos considering you guys wrote everything from scratch! :) This is inspiring, and I wish you guys all the very best!"

176uie,"Religion is the worlds oldest scam. It was created to keep people in line. You can't keep people in line without inspiring fear.

Helps that I haven't had to deal with the war issues that other seem to be experiencing (I am just fortifying my starbases) but I've been having a fun time. FWIW life-seeded is incredibly powerful if you manage to luck out and find some presapients near you. Uplift them (fairly early tech) and they can go colonize all the planets around you while you live in little habitats above them."

2ipt6s,"Well, remember that [the aliens aren't really trying to stop you but rather ""uplift"" the humans. So stuff like this could be considered purposefully ""tee hee, look at all this stuff we left behind"". IIRC Dr. Shen or one of the other characters ask why don't the aliens just send their best to decimate Earth right away? It's because they're testing humanity's capability to react, and it makes the abductions make a whole lot more sense in that it's testing the ability to respond to simultaneous attacks and prioritizing which place is in the most danger.](/spoiler)"

That's what capitalism did, imagine if we didn't keep trying to destroy it!"
16bcza,"Slash. While he's technically good, his playing just doesn't have the feeling behind it to make it visceral for me. Keith Richards, by comparison, isn't nearly as technical a player compared to Slash. But what he does play makes me happy, sad, excited, and inspired."
1683sl,"That is the meaning of the name. Maynard got the idea while attending West Point Military Academy whose Cadet Honor Code states, ""A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do."" They are expected to turn in even the best of friends for even the smallest infraction, or face a harsher punishment than the offender. Thus becoming a 'tool' of the academy. Also inspired lyrics to ""Intolerance."""
17oj20,"Alive With The Glory Of Love - Say AnythingA Walk Through Hell - Say AnythingThey both remind me only of love. Not really anyone in particular, but just of love.

4tv9g2,"Basically check if he is supportive in all facets. There is no point to a relationship if it isn't supportive. Is he supportive emotionally? aka- comfort you when you are down, as opposed to making it about himself.Is he supportive of your career/ambitions? aka- focus on you and uplift you when you talk about these things, as opposed to make it about himself. Or see your ambitions as a burden on him."
17k74n,"Everyone's been in this situation. you better do something about it before the flame goes off entirely. Find something non design related you love and make a design project out of it.. Love movies? start remaking posters. Love games? do some illustrations on them. Love sports? recreate your favorite team logo. Find a designer to collaborate with. You really just need someone to motivate you.This is probably unrelated but for me, I've been browsing design blogs for so damn much that instead of inspiring me, it sort of desensitized me. It just took over my design exploration."

78a26r,The issue is not that we need to uplift minorities. That's a dangerous line of thinking that leads to racism. The issue is that we need to uplift the poor and less fortunate so that they have a fair chance in life. It just so happens that the history of our world has lead certain minorities to being a great percentage of the poor and unfortunate than others.

7bd79m,"Well, in my setting the Hidden ""uplift"" other (intelligent) species to become their servants. They become genetically optimized and altered in many ways, it's not just enhanced strength for instance. One example are Uplifted Vaarj, these methane breathing insectoids gain a secondary set of lungs to function in a Earth-like environment.Now the big kicker is that most species won't figure out what is happening until it is too late. By that point the latest generation of children will be loyal to the Hidden and too powerful to stop."

4domxt,David Brin's Uplift series is most appropriate. John Scalzi's Old Man's War series would be fun in context as well.
1fnip1,"I want to add that there is also a technique on how to ollie higher: Slide more. Usually, your front foot is just behind the front bolts on a regular ollie. Although, since it really does depend on the slide, it is essential if you also ollie with your front foot on the middle of the board. That way, it will uplift you as the amount of speed, power of the pop and the height of your jump will result into a brief moment of feeling free as you fly with your ollie."

Seriously...watching edits and letting them inspire you will help you to improve so much.(as long as you play as much as you watch. Ha)Good luck man, cheers from America!!"
18r5ji,Go out and do it. I have never looked down on someone making an effort to better themselves. It is inspiring to see someone workin hard to improve their health. Anyone laughing doesn't know the work it takes.
1vahej,"I've written about this in more detail in comments I made in the past, but it's worth rehashing:Keto was the silver bullet that killed my lifelong anxiety and depression dead in its tracks. I still feel great 2.5 years into keto (and very much noticed the difference the few times I went back to non-keto eating -- a lot of the anxiety and angst came rushing right back).I'm so glad you are feeling the uplift (and kudos on the weightloss, too)."

6lajll,"If you look at what Sasha has said about winning, she seems to be the first to say that she plans to use her platform to encourage, support, and uplift artists around her. Talking about bringing Nightgowns on tour and giving opportunities to other exciting queer artists on the fringes of drag and gender art"
18rblj,"Present company excluded, what has been the most important collaboration of your musical careers as far as opening up new creative spaces and allow you to pursue some things that maybe you couldn't earlier in your careers?Thom, your music has been incredibly uplifting during some of the most traumatic and also beautiful moments of your life. I am not alone when I thank your parents for conceiving you, and you for being such a powerful force on this earth. I love you. We love you."
177jju,"nothing works for everyone. all self help is a lie. but it can be a useful lie.the lie can inspire hope which inspires action and in that action, can give you the chance - however infinitessimal - of success.the truth can indeed be harsh. and in its harshness inspire despair. which immobilizes. and in surrender and inaction, GUARANTEES failure.with the lie, chances are, you're gonna fail. but at least you have a SHOT."
16pe1f,"You just inspired me. I had my Internet bill lowered from $53.99 to $27 with a promise it wouldn't rise for 12 months. I had my phone bill lowered $20 a month (no changes to the plan aside from 150 minute reduction, but I keep my 6000+ rollover minutes) and they waived my upgrade fee by 50%. Annual Savings: $585"
17bink,"I knew this looked familiar! Went through the area when coming from Yosemite to go to Mammoth Lakes. If anyone has a traveling bug I'd highly recommend going to Yosemite, it is quite possibly one of the most gorgeous and serene locations I've ever been to. The view of the Milky Way from Glacier Point in Yosemite on a clear night is unmatched, if there is ever a moment in your life when you realize how insignificant your issues and problems are, it'll be during that view. Very few things are more awe inspiring."
184o50,"Huge congrats! Together, after 2 undergrads, 2 grads, teaching cert, a semester abroad, and the requisite poor choices of young people with no parental guidance in regards to responsible financing, we're near 40 yo with $100k in govmnt student loans and it scares the hell out of us. Trying to pay it down faster feels like dumping money in a bottomless pit. You're inspiring!"
17g2nz,"As a co-gamedev I'm very happy to hear that you're working on the hard bits that needed improvement in the prototype - UI, pathfinding, audio (darn crickets), furthering gameplay - rather than bang out a new polished-up prototype every week. Just a small heads-up - your project was so awesome and so inspiring that I registered on kickstarter just for you. I've since backed one other project, so you're ahead of the pack by quite a bit."
1702zl,I really enjoyed the way you retold this. Possibly the most interesting thing I've read all day.It's stories like this that inspire me into increasing the effort I put into LDing
17eb59,"It's likely that your revoking inspired his change around, you should congratulate yourself."
16t3qd,Simple answer: It is just to inspire and give ideas to other fashion designers. Weird fashion outfits have given many ideas for outfits purchased today.
16fqu2,I understand why people say its really not gonna make people smarter but it can inspire kids to pursue a future in music. I think it is not a bad idea to give kids a taste of music history for musical education.

18ioar,"Very similar experience for me. I get chills when hearing music or watching intense movies. That doesn't make those movies true. I told my brother once, ""we've got to have a hinge... Something to fallback on when our deceitful hearts lead us astray"" he said, ""what of the Holy Ghost?"" I replied,""if the Holy Ghost inspired the written word of God, why are we doing so many things contrary to his word???"" He ended up bearing his testimony... The trained response."
6cniiw,"when is charity not out to scam people for their money? quite a few of these organisations even pay their employees a generous salary for a job that essentially should be 100% volunteering. each country in the world should contribute money for issues such as cancer or poverty, hunger &amp; so many more, instead of asking the public to donate pennies here and there to give them a ""moral uplift"". so many of the worlds problems could be easily solved if there wasn't so many greedy and selfish leaders armed with their own private sinister agendas...."
16reh0,"I think the biggest impact is on people who are denied a proper education. Inserting creationism into schools damages the quality of the scientific education. It tells kids that scientists don't know what they are doing.The beauty of science is that we can be reasonably certain of things, and when religion gets in the way of science, it takes away the reasonableness and the certainty.A smart, curious kid is less likely to be inspired to engage in science if they are told that they won't learn any actual knowledge from it."

29i26r,"The end could be better...Having plants and trees. Maybe you'll have even to seek the ender dragon. There might be a new nearly invisible liquid - ""aether"" - where you can float on, and it's hard to dive in. The islands are connected with aether oceans. You won't see a ground of the oceans, but can't fall out of the world because you get a stronger uplift the lower you get."
18mp95,"Man, that video was inspiring! Great work, I had no idea about the refugees in Chattanooga, thanks for bringing that to light."

Hopefully these results will inspire future exoplanet hunting missions.If anyone is curious about the history of the Kepler mission, or exoplanet hunting in general, I would recommend Michael Lemonick's new book, *Mirror Earth*."

17mftj,I try my hardest to inspire and reach all of my students on a daily basis. I work very hard to make my subject interesting so that students will begin to care about school.
171u57,"IMO, to most, the real world represents debts, losses, negative emotions, and hardships. People use the phrase to define reality. “Well out here, in the real world…” But really, those people only view the pressures to achieve and compete alongside others who just want a better life for themselves. It is stressful at times, but equally beautiful and inspiring. If you lead your life using your gut-feelings and your soul instead of how much is in your bank account, you will see that the real world is a great thing to exist in."
648rpb,"I don't have that much hope sadly but I rather try to uplift others and share advice than doing nothing. Maybe it makes no difference, but at least I have tried doing something."
17ic0t,"The point I think most churches miss is the idea that while works cannot get us there our faith and belief should inspire works for those around us. These efforts to help improve other's lives becomes a witness to the world around us hopefully demonstrating a better way and making those who see the efforts want to know more. Preaching the above message to one of the lost won't turn their life around. Loving them and soothing their hurt has a better chance, imo."

16ut73,"I'd have to say Louis Pilloni. Many of his videos were the ones that inspired me to longboard, and he seems to always be so casual about every aspect of the scene. He lives the life of ""No hate, just skate""."
7bush3,You'll look to fulfill your world perspective and out-group derogation for some helps uplift they're own in-group thus increasing self-esteem derived from the collective. We as Americans are better
16kdem,This inspired me to get off the computer and do my homework! Then I finished and came back to Reddit... [](/megusta)
1828h3,"It's a show and there happens to be quite a few people that like it. We try to get along and accept each others differences, ultimately united by the series itself. Largely because of the large, adult fan-base, people have been inspired to create and share their creations with others. To whatever extents we take it too, we'll consider canon to be our pillar."
195rmv,These strips always held such power for me as a kid reading the Calvin and Hobbes books. Bill watterson is such a great inspiring artist.

16czah,"This is a great story. I am very sorry for you and for someone one who is just trying to get through school because I take it for granted, I am truly sorry. From someone who just takes it all for granted and really noticed how important an education is, I thank you.You're story is truly inspiring and I wish you the best of luck and know a strong-willed being that you are, will get somewhere in life. Time is all you need.Keep working hard to achieve what you want in life!"
17c1nu,That is a really cool way to commemorate your dad! I am really sorry for you loss but think it's pretty amazing that you have a poem like that from him. I think you just inspired me to give me dad a call tomorrow just to say hi.
2xoi5b,The aliens came and we were afraid. They wanted to uplift us but we shrank away. It wasn't until they came for real that we knew how human our dreams of them were.
18jifv,"Hey, great AMA! I don't really have a question but I just want to say that it's awesome how charismatic you can always be! You are always so happy and you can make anything fun, and that inspires me to do and try new things. You aren't afraid to look silly or be different and thats what makes you cool, because so many people limit what they want to do because they would be different and for me , and hopefully others, you inspire us. Thanks man!"
7ua1kz,This reminds me of the Blue Remembered Earth and sequels books by Alastair Reynolds. Sci-fi written as africa being the leading nation in tech etc.. and elephants being trained to use technology and made smarter is a large part of it and really interesting. The uplift book series by David Brin does the same with dolphins and is very interesting.

There are many people like you and I there, and you will never know how you inspired me today by just coming here to work out in this scary gym :) "" Or, you know, something like that. I have been there and would have made my day to get something like this. I remember what it feels like to think that everyone is staring at you making a fool of yourself on equipment that is sooo foreign!"
180xox,Thanks! So inspiring! I had never thought about life that way.
4fflc9,"The whole concept of 'uplifting' is you do it to creatures that are already sentient. Because generally a sentient species is going to take over the planet and you won't have 'half-sentient' alongside a fully sentient species.HOWEVER. I do like the idea that if you have 'wildlife' squares on your planet (which we've seen some of already) which you choose to not remove, you can uplift them - which I THINK you can do if you spare them for long enough to get that tech."

17rzyj,"I have two best friends. One comes from a divorced family. Her step brother had his first baby, and the next day, his wife dropped dead. My other best friend, who has never met the step-brother, arranged a sympathy card campaign for him.

I know my son and I are going to have a beautiful life together.""My best friend inspired me."

848g3f,Perhaps Uplift War by David Brin. It has a human male protagonist working with a female alien to defend against an invasion from another alien species. There is some romance. Oh and there are also a bunch of genetically enhanced chimps fighting with the humans.

197ji0,"First I just wanted to thank you for how much you have inspired me. I am a sufferer of panic disorder and up until 2 years ago it prevented me from traveling very far from my hometown. However, after reading A Cook's Tour I was so motivated by your descriptions of foreign countries that I sought more treatment and was able to go the UK for the summer :) My question for you is, what is one canned food item that everyone should try? In your trip to Spain it looked like there were some delicious canned seafood items."

17hetn,"Excellent story, congrats on your achievement. This is very inspiring to both newcomers and veterans."
17jz6i,"Lance Armstrong..No. Haha. Probably my ancestors. The people who lived before me, without them I would not exist. People struggling around the world, travelling to better their own lives - striving hard and long for food. From the hunter gatherers, the farmers, the village leaders, migrant workers, industrial business men, hard toilers and even failures - they all contributed to the world we live in today and the relative luxury we have in modern society.They inspire me to work hard. Work harder for my children and improve things for them; like they did for us."
16ehpe,"A friend of mine, who is also getting married, has also been gaining weight steadily. I would never EVER tell her she's getting bigger. I wouldn't want anyone to do that to me when I'm struggling. I sometimes invite her to workout with me and try to cook healthy meals when she comes over for dinner. She has yet to accept a workout invitation though. If you're extremely worried about her, maybe talk to her about your progress (don't brag!) and try to inspire her in a positive way."

4ag2dw,"Do the deed, do it yourself. It's all a hoax, so it doesn't matter that you play along. This is about your relationship with your son.

6euu08,"Set them free :). Disengage. If they hurt, manipulate, shame, belittle, etc. disengage from everything they do - cut them off from your life completely. It's not out of spite, it's the loving thing to do. I've found that there is often some kind of co-dependency, even if it feels like you're trying to uplift and help them. Trust and love yourself first and you'll find new connections. And friends and family might come around, but trust that they'll find their own way."

17bzp0,"Love never ends. It just changes form. May her physical absence awaken in you those things she inspired, so she may live on forever in you. You'll get better.

Then, after I expressed interest in learning to crochet myself, my mom taught me the bare bones basics! :D"
15s4s3,"No real resolutions, but it's my goal to do everything in my power to be a happier person.

The slime mold isn't really 'intelligent', it's just evolved a natural way of doing swarm intelligence optimization, which is kind of cool. We also see similarly inspiring behaviour with bees, krill, ants, fireflies and other organisms. Here's a project at the University of Plymouth that uses slime molds in music synthesis:"

7jxnx6,I try to change their opinion but if they continue to hold such negative views I eventually stop talking to them. If almost every single interaction with them leads to me having to be self-conscious about myself then I naturally kill the friendship. I try to reasonably uplift my friends and tell them that they can achieve anything; if I don't get the same treatment I'm outtie.How to not care what other people think of you? 1) Experience being in those situations 2) meditation.

16tnxr," I recently finished my first real album. I've messed around before, but never really put it together like it was meant to be an album. I've learned a lot about recording while making this, but I need to improve a lot. It's inspired by post-rock and a little bit of progressive rock. I'm not exactly proud of it, because something seems to be lacking. Give me all the criticism you have, please."
16opsy,Way to go! Your loss is really inspiring and I'm so happy to see your improvement. :D

18pv9e,"If you're looking for single-player mods, check out After The Fall and Nehahra for Quake, and They Hunger for Half-Life. For multiplayer, there's DotA for WarCraft III, Threewave CTF for Quake that standardized CTF in every game, and Challenge ProMode Arena for Quake III Arena.Pretty much all of the popular games inspired by mods were mods of either Quake, Half-Life, or WarCraft III."

90e915,"Well, the most important thing is knowing how much you love yourself.When going to movies with friends to uplift your emotions, you're sure that if these friends all busy and cancel the date, you can still go watch that movie alone and enjoy your time But if you devastated and beg for them to come or so, you are too needy and dependent. Recommend spending more alone time to learn how to enjoy solitude and cherish yourself more as a company."
18m7tw,"Big on the bands that came from my hometown. Silverstein, Dead &amp; Divine, Boys Night Out. Really inspiring seeing these bands play the local YMCA, then a couple years later be on world tours."
26e7c7,"Honestly, I think in past lives I've always been a healer of some sort. A mother/mother figure. A psychologist. Something along empathic lines because that's a MAJOR part of who I am today. I always want to uplift people. I want to help, to listen, to advise where I can. I want to learn and inform others. To help them be their best, I find solace in that for my own life. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present."
16mq0g,As a model myself I find you very inspiring what you have achieved &amp; have become over the years you have proved that anything is impossible if you put your heart &amp; soul into it. I would love to know what inspired you to become an artist yourself.

17x074,"MF DOOM, Eyedea, Gang Starr, Necro, Earl Sweatshirt, Mos Def, and Aesop Rock are the first ones that come to mind. Each one has a vastly different, yet talented style and each one is capable of packing that style with as much rhyming as possible. Whenever I feel writer's block coming on, I turn to listening to these artists to inspire me and get the creative juices flowing."
188ho4,"I couldn't choose one single favorite. I'd have to choose both ""The Stranger"" and ""The Plague"" by Albert Camus. Both deal with very similar subjects, but whereas one is sort of negative, the other shows how a seemingly nihilistic philosophy can bring about intense meaning and value in a person's life. They inspire me."
17yg9j,"I could imagine hearing Carl Sagan narrate one of his poetic speeches about our role in the world and universe with this stunning piece of art tickling my retinas and inspiring my conscience. This did that well enough on it's own, but could you imagine how esoterically stimulating that would be?"
3t0pud,"I try not to concern myself with negativity. We know the world is full of evil, why give it an audience? You can easily find darkness when you're looking for it, and it takes a concerted effort to seek out the light. I would rather support BLM by doing something to uplift our own community."
16f3b4,"This is the first time I participate in this :) I love the work I am seeing from you guys, it is inspiring. Recently I decided that to rekindle my love with coding I should stop pure application development and start doing some game development alongside my day to day development at work.I am working on a roguelike game via the html5 canvas. Not very far along, currently have the main character, dungeon generator and line of sight completed. Working on the enemy AI right now.Screenies:Test it out:Question answer: Just me."

16ozrz,"It's great to read a story like this. It's also great to see how happy they all seem with each other. I liked the mother talking about how they may not have the money for private schools, but if they focus on what's important, things will fall into place. Inspiring."
17mzv1,"The Ancient Greeks actually discovered/invented Calculus, It just happened to be rediscovered/reinvented during the Renisannce. You have to remember a lot of things we're lost after the fall of Rome and the burning at the Library of Alexandria. The West reclaimed alot of knowledge during The Crusades, inspiring new thought, which is the Renisannce."
15s0tp,"Charles Darwin's views were similar to Hitler's, and inspired Hitler's 'superior' race.Darwin believed that 'positive eugenics' (encouraging people with 'strongest' traits to breed 'superior' offspring) was a good idea. There is even a book called 'From Darwin to Hitler'.Also thought I would make it clear that i'm not putting down any of Darwin's scientific work, he was undoubtedly one of the most forward thinking people of the time. I am just mentioning one morally questionable, and possibly very influential, view on eugenics."
192ezg,"He would be my greatest rival and closest friend. I would discuss with him philosophy and make stupid jokes that only we understand because we have a twisted mind. I would inspire myself to be the best person I could be, because I would know that if I asked myself for help, I would gladly accept. I think if I had a copy of myself, I'd become a a far better person. Like... Twice the man. Or something."
18dazb,A very inspiring docu indeed. I felt it too when he was sad or disappointed about the quality of fish that we have and how it has declined over the years.

168uc4,Her movie work inspired a young TheHarber to enjoy singing as much as she seemed to on-screen. This is quite a loss.
830p0w,"*Startide Rising* is a better book for ideas and the world-building aspect of the galaxy. It's also a more fun book.*The Uplift War* is smaller scope and is better for the character building, nuance, and feels more ""literary"" in its approach.I don't think one is better than the other, they're both good, but for different reasons."
17nyzf,"This is insanely inspiring as I'm in Australia studying to be a programmer, I hope to start up my own studio in Melbourne too!"
15vw68,So nice to see a girl with a bush. Your body is truly inspiring.
17uo6d,"Congrats man. Honestly, I have yet to get tired of these posts. Seeing people improve is really inspiring. Man im such a slacker."
17fel2,"&gt;Don't worry too much about your fat/carb/protein mix, just keep carbs to less than 20g a day which I managed easily.Sometimes I get scared when people remark about the percentages and macros, that confuses me! Because I've read that if you eat too much protein, *something something* glucose *something*; and too little fat, you don't lose weight. I still try, tho'.And congratulations! You are truly inspiring, I hope to reach one full year on keto getting closer to my ideal weight."

15tg61,"One story finished and submitted, another previously-finished was submitted, and a third queued for submission once the market reopens tomorrow.Tomorrow's a writing day - I need a story idea! Right now, inspired by a recent Wired article, I'm tossing around an idea about a prenatal test for magic, and a choice to be made... it may start with a hill of white elephant bones... the meat is missing, though. Hopefully it will come to me by 7 AM :)edit: perhaps serendiptiously, this image just showed up:Dunno what it has to do with my story, but I think it might."
4m18pn,"thats the WT circle of life. Uplift, breakdown then uplift again. Give the R&amp;F a ""happy"" convention like Imitate Jeezuz, have them feeling all warm and fuzzy inside, then bring the darkness, like this years convention. make them feel like they arent doing enough, that they will probably die at the Big A."

3wevms,"I love David Brin's ""[The Uplift War]( which posits a galactic civilization built around sentient species ""uplifting"" other species -- genetically modifying them so they evolve sentience themselves and in turn can take their place in society, going on to uplift other species in turn.It's the last of a trilogy but honestly, you don't need the other two. I read it as a standalone and didn't have any trouble keeping up, since 99% of what's in there doesn't really rely on what went before."
18uxy4,Jericho Mile was what inspired me to try running when I was a teenager. Now I watch it and notice the tired stereotypes and bad acting. But I still like it.

32osww,"I hope this implies no effect to other species or ecosystems because otherwise this thread will be filled with so many dead species.I'd uplift humanity (still an animal) so we can get past this stupidity and protect each other and the environment.To be true to the question: i would uplift dogs. They've always been there for us and see our best and worst. We could learn a lot from their observations, their short positive lives, and how they see the world."

17zm35,You look amazing! You have inspired me this morning. Thank you for pictures.
18ztwe,"I feel similar to what you are feeling. I think I have been dealing with at least a minor form of depression as well, involving things like crying myself to sleep on occasion, and getting sad for extended periods of time over small things. I don't even know why I'm typing this, but if there is anything I can say to help you, it is that I find listening to emotional music REALLY helps me through bad periods. I listen to Uplifting Trance, and afterwards, I feel like I can get on with my day without feeling sad."
182kx1,"You look great! You go, girl! You have inspired me, and I am trying to ditch the anxiety, depression and win back the self confidence. I have a wonderful boyfriend, but I have so many other stresses (including finances, work, school, social, relationships, life, debt, etc). I feel overwhelmed by my life so often. I am trying to slap myself out of that slump and you have inspired me! Keep up the good work! And thank you for the inspiration I needed!"

16yz28,"Take a break, maybe just from that song, or in general. Also It helps to ""revisit"" that emotion that inspired you, like go to the place where it hit you, or listen to that song again, or look at that picture again, retrace your steps so to say."
16xzhw,"Love your work and find you very inspiring. What are some of your favourite philosophers/works of philosophy? Also, is there any of your academic work on philosophy that you would like to share? EDIT: Just to contextualize this, I'm always very interested in the those who create art with backgrounds in philosophy, and within that how these parts of conscious experience inform each other, however in directly."
828eq9,"I made a post on here that coffee uplift me and helps me make better decisions and I always feel so incredibly happy almost as if getting a slight high (lol). Coffee takes my anxiety away, unlike most people...do you experience that too? I dont feel depressed after I think it's most likely the caffeine wearing off that's why they say the best time to have coffee is 2pm apparently so you crash around bedtime"
18oyr5,"I agree and would add history as well. There is mystery not so much in discovering what is going on in the present, but discovering the past that leads up to now. Marathon gives clues as to how things came to be, Halo has the ancient Forerunner buildings to inspire wonder, Destiny will have ruins to explore and a history shrouded in uncertainty."

18l7di,"That is such a good idea! My local humane society puts the most blurry, unflattering animal pictures on their website. You've inspired me to do the same once I get a decent camera! I go there a lot to walk dogs and play with them, but I'd love to do something to increase their chances of finding a good home."
1853ap,"President Gwynne Shotwell is my personal idol. I wrote a college essay discussing how inspiring she is, and how she has my dream job! SpaceX is my favorite company of all time, and I hope to one day work there (I'm considering pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering, but am more interested in the business of space exploration). She's an inspiration to women everywhere and sounds like an amazing and talented person. I hope to one day meet her!Thank for changing the world guys, I can't wait to see what SpaceX does."
28nd3q,Mistweaver healing is very different from other healing specs. You don't really need much spirit. You only have to spend the chi you generate so you'll have mana tea to drink and get your mana. Use Chi brew talent for extra mana tea. You can practice mana management in LFR.In 10M Uplift really shines but in 25 man aoe healing of MW lags behind.
16rgbe,"Such intelligent and uplifting encouragement! I was just put in charge of the coffee program at the cafe in which I work because of my dedication, even though I have less bar experience. All it takes is your saying to the Universe 'I am the person for this job who can uplift the environment and those around me.' Own it!"

16wo6h,"Probably a pretty different book from Blindness or The Hot Zone (which I loved), is Geraldine Brooks' ""Year of Wonders."" The book was inspired by the true story of Eyam, an English village that voluntarily isolated itself during the plague of 1666."
5pybsa,"I do actually! My first time period makes the world a fantasy one that has a low technology level, probably equivalent to that of ancient history. Although they do have magic which does uplift their quality of living significantly.The next is about a thousand years in the future where magitek reigns supreme. With magical technology used for space travel, teleportation, and all sorts of weird science fantasy. The setting jumps from one continent to an entire star cluster in breadth and scope."

7b3h6u,Would David Brin [the Uplift series]( fit the description? I must say I have only read one of the books while reading books by joint winners of Hugo and Nebula awards. But it is a series of 6 books I believe and it revolves around the crew of the Earthship called Streaker in an intergalactic war between species who are or used to be allied together and have rules regarding the uplifting (as they call it) of species to a next level of development.
189i0h,Adelino's on 3rd street downtown right near Chumleys has tapas style food and Mediterranean inspired dishes. They also have options for those who have food allergies or are vegetarian. Maza on 52 is also good. Be forewarned that both are closed on Sundays.

7kq4ei,"Perhaps you haven't found your people yet. I've experienced similar inability to connect with my peers. It's hard to make new friends as an adult female, but worth it. Finding people that uplift you without even trying has been such a blessing, don't settle for relationships that require too much energy with nothing in return. You deserve better."
172h79,Infatuation lust and love. You can inspire all of them. You are very beautiful
15s8nc,"By listing the artists and other creatives (da Vinci etc) that religion has directly inspired, he has kind of underscored for me that religion has a place in the world, in terms of inspiring wonder. Likewise in recent times atheists have been inspired by the presence of religion e.g. Pink Floyd and The Beatles. We should all celebrate our diversity!EDIT: for clarity"

1907qg,"You could also make it a positive thing. If its a good friend you can use it as motivation to get better at those things and figure out how they are good and adapt to get better. You might never get better than them, but if you did then you would try to grow anymore. Let it be a constant learning session and eventually you'll not only improve but see that you're better at those things over everyone else and maybe that'll be more inspiring than just being better than your one friend."

It was both horrifying and inspiring at the same time.[This video]( gets me every time. The moment during the Isha prayer when Mubarak stepped down, and these brothers kept it in line and calm to finish the prayer while everyone around them was cheering. It's a long video but definitely worth the watch."

There's an ethicist names Dvorksy who thinks that once we have the tech, we are morally obligated to ""give consciousness"" to all animals, and basically bring their level of intelligence to our own.

Maybe this time, fans could put together a collage of videos or messages to uplift to community? Maybe targeting those who are having a rough time and need some motivation to keep on going? To show that they aren't alone? Life is tough, so it's nice to know that there are people out there that care when you thought no one did."
16mq0g,I am sure this will get lost in the shuffle here but just want to let you know you have always been a personal hero of mine. I grew up watching your movies and can quote just about all of them. Your career both in and out of the gym inspired me to become not only a better lifter but a better person. I have always admired you and just hope this message reaches you. Thanks for being you.
18tk7t,"Wow, cannot believe you're a redditor as well! I'm pretty much in utter admiration after I saw you at the Olympics. You inspired me to continue lifting when I was in London this summer, while trying to justify getting into a healthy lifestyle with my brother-in-law. And also, you did a great job and had great sportsmanship.If you ever find yourself in Lancaster, a training session at The Muscle Factory is on me!"
1oubd9,"Here's a good article describing the current situation there. In 2006-07, they drilled seven 140 metre deep geothermal heat exchange wells for the Town Hall near the centre of the town (heat exchangers are supposed to pump cold water underground and pump warm water back out in a closed loop). Seemed a good idea at the time. Most of the uplift happened from July 2008 through May 2011. Subsequent remediation work, involving filling in the geothermal wells and drilling two other wells to abstract water, has slowed the uplift."
16yax6,"Although you're 2 inches taller than, me, you're doing what I'm hoping to do! I'm at 150 now and hoping to get to 125-130 by eating less. I worked out a lot last semester, but was not losing any weight. I'm trying a different approach this time, eating 1200 calories/day. Did you ever have any ""cheat days"" or days that you let yourself go over 1400? If so, did you make it up by eating less the next day?Thanks, and you are very inspiring! :) Congrats!"
2hnwmf,Listen. Let them talk. Ask questions if needed. At the very end see if you can throw something their way to uplift them based on a possible experience you had

35306r,"Personally, while I have been blessed by having gurus in my life, I feel that many of us forget what the word ""guru"" means. IMHO, It's not *just* a person who instructs us, but it is the divine principle we have as human beings to uplift, teach, and dispel the darkness of ignorance from other minds.I don't remotely consider myself a guru, but when I attempt to answer people's questions on /r/hinduism to the best of my ability, I hope I am doing my small part in perpetuating the guru principle.Jai Maa."

SO GOOD.*Ringworld*, *Neutron Star*, *Tales of Known Space* by Larry Niven (the latter two are collections of short stories) satisfy both criteria."
16znvp,"Black History mainly just teaches about civil rights. So, you basically learn that the only important black people were civil rights leaders. And one dude that did stuff with peanuts. If we hope to inspire children teaching about black scientists, authors and businessmen or even African kings and queens would be much more useful. It's a wonderful thing to have a black president. At least there are now role models outside of sports and music."
174kb1,"I don't know how he'll turn out this year, but I hope its good! He definitely has the skill set. He most certainly can pull his own weight on the first line.

8b0x55,"You probably won't find anything at that price point. You get what you pay for and if your budget is that low, I suggest waiting a bit. I started searching 6 months ago and realized this so I kept saving. I finally placed the order for my Uplift Desk over the weekend!"

168vvx,"A lot of people have given practical guitar suggestions already, so I'll throw in a motivational one, ""Becoming Jimi"" about Jimi Hendrix's early years in the United States before he went over to England. It's a very cool biography, and it inspired me to learn how to play more songs instead of just noodling every time I picked up the guitar. Paraphrasing Jimi himself, ""Learn the chords and the rest will follow"", which, when you look at his phrases and riffs, you can see they are very chord based (think Little Wing)"
257wap,"I recenly bought Contacting Aliens: An Illustrated Guide To David Brin's Uplift Universe, I can't vouch for it as I bought it then left to go overseas, so it hadn't arrived before I left, but it seems like the kind of thing you're looking for. Also check out the Star Wars encyclopedias, I used to love them as a kid because they have photos, cross sections and explanations of a ton of different star ships, weapons and gadgets, also explanations on different alien species and characters."
17ae3x,"In my case I looked at it in a different perspective. I didn't become depressed like most of the watchers did.I learned a lot from Clannad and instead of thinking of it as something sad, I think of it as something inspiring.I'd recommend you to try to focus on what Clannad has taught you (to value all the things you have, etc)"
18y9gn,"Better off in what way? Spending time with a kid who has autism can be humbling. It can inspire you and teach you empathy and patience. There's a lot of ways we can learn and grow spending time with people who are different than us. To me, our advancement as a species is more based on our mental growth and mental evolution than it is our physical bodies... Unless of course the person is also a ginger. Then we should maybe consider your approach."

6bw0f5,"Protecting humankind is still their main doctrine. They would take over the world and try to uplift them probably to make them be able to protect themselves, also spread the Imperial Truth. Space marines don't believe the Emperor is God. And as soon as they arrive and start subduing the governments of Earth, Emperor would probably reveal himself. Read the minds of marines, and probably take over.The problem is the Eldar are at the height of their power. And if humanity would try to expand and get noticed, it might get extinguished."

I'm a new atheist and I have to say, right now I would definitely be wanting a god to come and care for me if anything happened to my family or friends.

18pgqg,"Bus That Can't Slow Downis insanely powerful and fun. In my experience (which I'd rank as considerable but not awe inspiring) it's proven to be invaluable. Moving faster means you'll be better at closing gaps, avoiding harm, and finding cover. Point for point I'd say it's the strongest defensive and offensive skill available. Plus it's fun to listen to your friends laugh when they see your tiny little legs churning at 100mph."
16mq0g,"Mr Schwarzenegger, you have inspired me more than any other person on this earth, thank you for what you have done, and what you will do.Q: What did you tell yourself when your spirits were low, how do you reinvigorate your drive when times get difficult and it seems bleak?"

My experience fighting the Grox was that it wasn't especially hard taking out any given Grox system - they just have *so many* that it will take forever.I've heard about an alternate strategy that might help, if you're interested. If you ally with empires that border the Grox (or with new empires in Grox territory you uplift via monoliths), you can then instruct them to attack the Grox.

8dafjd,"All kinds of crazy stuff has been happening to the western United States over the past 100 or so million years. The result is the complicated and uplifted jumble you see today. It's why the mountains are so tall and the geography so rough. The great plains are actual made of eroded outwash from the Rockies (look at an elevation map - they're flat but they get high) because that far east, there hasn't been any uplift for millions of years, just mostly stable land.

5z1tdc,"I really enjoyed *Sundiver* by David Brian. It's the first in the Uplift series. Humanity/Earth is discovered by aliens (multiple races), the aliens though all have been given intelligence by previous aliens through genetic manipulation and education. This results is a indentured servitude for an entire species to another. Humans though do not have a sponsor, as far as we know we just evolved our own intelligence. Some aliens races are okay with this, most are not. This of course leads to conflict and controversy"

2dzku2,"'Uplifting' done right. In many series, it is taboo to uplift a less advanced civilization (e.g., Prime Directive in Star Trek) or when it does happen it often has negative consequences. But there are many arguments that could be made that it is a good thing (e.g., should advanced nations not help develop Africa? Is that different than the idea of helping advance an entire planet?). Would be fun to see it played out."
15yk31,"This is a tough one. Music is emotional and evocative in different ways to different people. Books are emotional and evocative also in different ways.

In general, I find [postrock]( to be a good accompaniment to many scifi and fantasy books.I know, you said soundtrack, but I don't have any soundtracks."

People are inspired by other people's stories all the time, of course they're going to seep into their own works.

17bysn,"When I was a teenager I was the second fastest sprinter female in my school. I loved the feeling of taking off like lightning...that was many years and 70 lbs ago. This subreddit along with /r/loseit, /r/running, and /r/Paleo, have inspired me to pick it up again while trying to get back to healthy. I've only finished my W1D1 and wow, it feels a lot different running with 200 lbs than it did running at 130. I visit these subreddits daily for motivation."
16jea2,"I'm reading [Seven languages in seven weeks]( which has introductions to seven languages: Ruby, Io, Prolog, Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell.I'm in the Erlang chapter now, so I'm about halfway through the book. I can recommend it, it's very inspiring to read about the different languages. He compares the languages when he introduces new concepts. It doesn't go into great depth on the different languages, but gives a great head start if you really want to learn one of them.Edit: [The introduction]( of the book is free of charge."

16v22d,"Looking out into the cosmos, we are looking back in time. This thought always blows my mind. That we can literally look back in time upwards to 14 billion years... man. Science is awe inspiring."
16qcwe,"When it's snowing at night, and all the flakes reflect the light from the street lights. The whole night is lit up in this awe inspiring orange-ish amazing-ness.

16uirb,"Apparently those people helped the guy out when he was really down and trying to make it in life, without truly even knowing him back then or him having anything to give them in return. Inspiring."

15vy9z,I would say that it would be more accurate to say that Religion funded and inspired the building of some of the greatest structures in history. Science and architecture is what built them.
15rwj1,"Who would think that a picture of a notebook would be inspiring, but it is.I wrote a ton when I was younger - nothing any good, really, but I would just write. I haven't done that in probably 15 years.I think I need to write again.Thank you for the post."

18ikui,"Awesome! I loved the Tamagotchi as a boy--and still like the idea behind it.I have created a live wallpaper that borrows a lot of stuff from the Tamagotchi style and feel. It was directly inspired by the Tamagotchi. It is called [Kotori Live Wallpaper]( It has been out for some time, but I feel it's appropriate to post it here. I hope it is. All of the art is hand drawn on paper with a pencil. The wallpaper itself is very integrated with your phone; ie. it will act on incoming text messages, emails, music playback and stuff like that."
16qcwe,"Listening to music and getting inspired to write a story. Also, the soft turbulent breeze from the fan because it feels like I am outside on a cool breezy day. And Florida is anything *but* cool and breezy right now. Actually...It's about to rain. Maybe it'll cool down."
15rwj1,"I've written a lot (though not every day) these past months, and just a warning to you and anyone else going on this endeavor: there will be times when you feel your poetic inspiration is totally spent, i.e. writer's block. The best thing to do is read poetry, not in a hurry, but really get into some poems, read, interpret, reread. You can also do this with other art forms, like listening to some inspiring music, but poetry really is the best way to inspire poetry. Good luck!"

18fhxt,This is a truly inspiring story and I appreciate you sharing it.
16yo7u,"Ringworld is the only book to really convey upon me a truly awe inspiring sense of scale. There were times when I had to put the book down and really contemplate the sheer size of what was being told to me. Such masterful writing, I recommend it just for that alone."
169og7,This sounds like the same arguments as the Cranston prayer banner. Perhaps some students need to get inspired by Miss Alquist.

When I have to adjust my seat or steering wheel it's like a secret reminder to myself that my body is changing. i hope you continue to notice NSVs, and I hope they inspire and even surprise you. No matter how you notice your progress (scale or otherwise) please don't forget that you ARE making progress, and thank yourself for it :)"
15xb4s," ""I Get the Blues When It Rains"" I nice uptempo fingerstyle blues rag, easy vocals. I recently came across this video on YouTube that inspired me to learn it. This girl, Macyn Taylor, is an excellent player. Check out some of her other videos. It was also recorded by Big Bill Broonzy back in 1956. Lots of room here to rearrange as you see fit.[Macyn Taylor version]([Big Bill Broonzy version]("

172cmh,"The greatest problem in teaching SF and/or fantasy is getting the right mix of novels, short stories,etc. The authors who inspired other authors sometimes is a fun way to approach this--Jack Vance who inspires Gene Wolfe, G.R.R. Martin, LeGuin, Gaiman, John C. Wright,etc.Then a look at some of the works they wrote. Or Doc Smith and all the space opera.....sometimes it is also fun to pick one trope and play with all its variations."

17cl0n,"""our last speaker is very inspiring, here she is""""now, I will speak for a minute and a half about how you should do some stuff, and not actually mention the words ""gun"" or ""control,"" or any other word that would indicate I am speaking about a particular topic. in fact, this synopsis is longer than my actual speech""wut? also, I liked this bit""how will you take my guns away?""""YES WE WILL, YES WE WILL""""how will you take my guns away?""you are being ridiculous, nobody is going to take your guns away"""

171ukg,I like to make balloon animals and then throw them angrily as hard as I can. Watching them float slowly when I want nothing more than to destroy things is extremely uplifting. I go from upset to cracking up in no time flat as I watch those balloons drift back and forth on their way to the ground.
15vy9z,"If you change ""made"" to ""inspired,"" I would actually agree. Same goes for art."

17jzzs,I suggest you try Ghost Master. It's a non-violent strategy game where you must use your ghosts wisely to inspire fear in the living. It's a really cheap game on Steam and it's wonderfully unique.

16qzva,"Thanks for sharing. It's things like this that inspire hope that some day I will get to take some grand adventures of my own.But, as for now, you have prompted a new pin in my map of beautiful places I must see. Funny this hasn't been on my radar as of yet."
16ep8x,"I suggest praying for other people. It may not tell God anything he doesn't already know, but it helps you keep it in mind, and therefore it may help you act as God's instrument in helping those people. Because, of course, prayer alone is not the point. It's about prayer plus action. And if you are already acting, well, perhaps prayer will help remind you why you are doing so and inspire you to keep doing so."
18d9ln,"One of the jokes my coach telled me: (inspired)Knock knockWho's there?The guy in second placeThe guy in second place who?Exactly.Strive for the best, never settle for second place. Be a winner, be remembered!"

187c3e,"Dude the only way you start panicking is if you start thinking of everything that will make you panic.

16qjol,He could inspire the youth by not getting caught up with land scams and corruption. OH WAIT.
16qhyb,"I seriously think the internet. It has inspired further research, creation, invention, communication, etc...

The possibilities are endless now that we have this intercontinental connection from something as little as a phone in our pockets."

It actually inspired a lot of emotion within me.As a woman I'm pressured a lot that my ultimate worth is in how many kids I can have, and that I'm never a complete person until I have some.

18q8ff,"_Day of the Triffids_ by John Wyndham. Older science fiction, kind of precursor to new-wave, the book is a fast read but rich in thought. It inspired a movie of the same name, a movie that I recall being rather bad. The book however is genius."
1733f5,"&gt;“I’d stop if I could find somebody who does things like I do. Debby is getting tired.”&gt;But for now, they’ll carry on. “When they need me, they need me,” Dr. Burns says of his patients.That's inspiring but at the same time a bit sad. I can't believe the state mandated statements they have to make."

16rmao,"Had to wipe my eyes - gotta see someone about these contact lenses... On a serious and uplifting note: if people can find statistics to support ""dads who are connected don't reoffend"" (I believe it, but statistics are king) there should be funding and serious support for making this a viable project across America. In an ideal world we'd disband that disaster of a program D.A.R.E. and use those funds for something awesome and amazing that's positive and actually works."
15x1z7,"You can't make her happier. You can be supportive and listen to her when she needs someone to talk to. You can suggest that she get counseling if that's an option for her. You can inspire her to go out and take up new activities and meet new people. You can spend time with her doing fun things or help her with her chores.But you can't make her happy. That's up to her. And part of that is just healing from her losses, which takes time and some mental effort."

1756v5,"Humilty is absolutely vital. Always demand nothing short of perfection from yourself, and never be satisfied. When your team mates see that in you, it will inspire them to find it in themselves. If you are trying to become a better leader, I encourage you to read John Wooden on Leadership.

17usff,"Considering the examples already put forward I'm guessing mine aren't going to be particularly popular. The first person who got interested and thinking about politics is veteran British (I myself am British) Statesman Tony Benn, described as ""one of the few UK politicians to have become more left-wing after holding ministerial office.""As I became more interested in radical left-wing thinking Noam Chomsky inspired me further"

15tp1a,"My thought is that late at night people can no longer ignore what they will be forced to do the next day (maybe go to school/work, maybe wake up and need to look for jobs, etc.) which for most people isn't what they want to be doing. So when thinking ""ugh, I really don't want to go to the job I have tomorrow,"" people then become inspired to go back to school and obtain a new skill set, for example."
18cxro,This girl's awkwardness inspired the home schooling episode of South Park. The home schooled girl who wins the Spelling Bee was even named Rebecca. Only clip I can find of the episode though -
